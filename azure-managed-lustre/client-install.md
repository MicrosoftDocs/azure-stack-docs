# Install prebuilt Lustre client software

In this article, you learn how to download and install a Lustre client package. After you install the package, you can set up client virtual machines (VMs) and attach them to an Azure Managed Lustre cluster. Select an operating system version to see the instructions.

If you need to upgrade an existing Lustre client to the current version, see [Upgrade Lustre client software to the current version](client-upgrade.md).

For more information on connecting clients to a cluster, see [Connect clients to an Azure Managed Lustre file system](connect-clients.md).

> These instructions apply only to the AlmaLinux 8.6 HPC images in Azure Marketplace. For all other AlmaLinux 8 installations, including HPC and general marketplace, refer to the [Red Hat 8 instructions](install-rhel-8.md).

1. Install and configure the Azure Managed Lustre repository for the DNF package manager. Create the following script and name it `repo.bash`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -ex

   rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc

   DISTRIB_CODENAME=el8

   REPO_PATH=/etc/yum.repos.d/amlfs.repo
   echo -e "[amlfs]" > ${REPO_PATH}
   echo -e "name=Azure Lustre Packages" >> ${REPO_PATH}
   echo -e "baseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/amlfs-${DISTRIB_CODENAME}" >> ${REPO_PATH}
   echo -e "enabled=1" >> ${REPO_PATH}
   echo -e "gpgcheck=1" >> ${REPO_PATH}
   echo -e "gpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" >> ${REPO_PATH}
   ```

1. Run the script as a superuser:

   ```bash
   sudo bash repo.bash
   ```

1. Install the metapackage that matches your running kernel:

   [!INCLUDE [client-install-version-hpc-alma-86](./includes/client-install-version-hpc-alma-86.md)]

> Ubuntu 18.04 LTS reached the end of standard support on May 31, 2023. We recommend either migrating to the next Ubuntu LTS release or upgrading to Ubuntu Pro to gain access to extended security and maintenance from Canonical. For more information, see the [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/linux-and-open-source-blog/canonical-ubuntu-18-04-lts-reaching-end-of-standard-support/ba-p/3822623).

1. Ensure that you have Ubuntu Pro activated and are on the recommended 5.4 kernel, which the `linux-image-azure` metapackage provides:

   ```bash
   apt list --installed linux-image*
   ```

1. Install and configure the Azure Managed Lustre repository for the APT package manager. Create the following script and name it `repo.bash`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -ex

   apt update && apt install -y ca-certificates curl apt-transport-https lsb-release gnupg
   source /etc/lsb-release
   echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/amlfs-${DISTRIB_CODENAME}/ ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amlfs.list
   curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null

   apt update
   ```

1. Run the script as a superuser:

   ```bash
   sudo bash repo.bash
   ```

1. Install the metapackage that matches your running kernel.

    The following command installs a metapackage that keeps the version of Lustre aligned with the installed kernel. For this alignment to work, you must use `apt full-upgrade` instead of `apt upgrade` when updating your system.

1. Install and configure the Azure Managed Lustre repository for the APT package manager. Create the following script and name it `repo.bash`:

   apt update
   ```

1. Run the script as a superuser:

   ```

1. Install the metapackage that matches your running kernel.

    The following command installs a metapackage that keeps the version of Lustre aligned with the installed kernel. For this alignment to work, you must use `apt full-upgrade` instead of `apt upgrade` when updating your system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Marketplace image for the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release uses the Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel by default. However, HWE kernels are supported only for six-month periods, and Lustre support for these kernels is often not available when they're released. We recommend that you switch to the LTS kernel because it gives you more stability and it maintains a kernel version that's supported with the Lustre client.

1. Install the LTS kernel metapackage:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install linux-image-azure-lts-22.04
   ```

1. Remove the default (HWE) kernel metapackage. The response to the following command also asks you to remove the `linux-azure` metapackage.

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove linux-image-azure
   ```

1. List installed kernels and see which one the LTS metapackage supplies:

   ```bash
   apt list --installed linux-image*
   ```

   Newly provisioned hosts have two kernels, and older hosts might have more. Compare the version that the LTS metapackage provides against the other installed kernels.

1. Remove any kernels newer than the one mentioned in the LTS metapackage.

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove linux-image-6.8.0-1027-azure
   ```

   You receive a warning about removing the kernels, but these steps work if you're following them on a newly provisioned host. If you have concerns, consult Ubuntu documentation on configuring kernels to ensure that they can start after a restart.

1. List installed kernels again to verify that you don't have kernels newer than the one mentioned in the LTS metapackage:

   ```bash
   apt list --installed linux-image*
   ```

1. Restart to load the LTS kernel.

1. Install and configure the Azure Managed Lustre repository for the APT package manager. Create the following script and name it `repo.bash`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -ex

   apt update && apt install -y ca-certificates curl apt-transport-https lsb-release gnupg

   curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
