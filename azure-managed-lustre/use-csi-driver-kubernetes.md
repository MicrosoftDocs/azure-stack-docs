# Use the Azure Managed Lustre CSI driver with Azure Kubernetes Service

In this article, you learn how to plan, install, and use [Azure Managed Lustre](/azure/azure-managed-lustre) in [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/) with the [Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver). This driver is based on the Container Support Interface (CSI) specification.

You can use the Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes to access Azure Managed Lustre storage as persistent storage volumes from Kubernetes containers deployed in AKS.

## Compatible Kubernetes versions

The Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes is compatible with [AKS](/azure/aks/). Other Kubernetes installations are not currently supported.

AKS Kubernetes versions 1.21 and later are supported. This support includes all versions currently available when you're creating a new AKS cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes currently works only with the Ubuntu Linux OS SKU for node pools of AKS.

## Compatible Lustre versions

The Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes is compatible with [Azure Managed Lustre](/azure/azure-managed-lustre). Other Lustre installations are not currently supported.

For a complete list of all driver releases and their changelog, see the [Azure Lustre CSI driver releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/releases).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A terminal environment with the Azure CLI tools installed. See [Get started with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl), the Kubernetes management tool, installed in your terminal environment. See [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by using the Azure CLI](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli#connect-to-the-cluster).
- An Azure Managed Lustre deployment. See the [Azure Managed Lustre documentation](/azure/azure-managed-lustre).
- **Network connectivity** between your AKS cluster and Azure Managed Lustre virtual network. See [network architecture planning](#determine-the-network-architecture-for-interconnectivity-of-aks-and-azure-managed-lustre) below for configuration options.

## Plan your AKS deployment

When you're deploying Azure Kubernetes Service, several options affect the operation between AKS and Azure Managed Lustre.

### Determine the network type to use with AKS

AKS supports multiple networking models, each with different capabilities and use cases. All networking models work with the Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes, but they have different requirements for virtual networking and cluster setup.

For comprehensive information about choosing the right networking model for your specific requirements, see [Azure Kubernetes Service CNI networking overview](/azure/aks/concepts-network-cni-overview).

When creating an AKS cluster in the Azure portal, you'll see the following networking options:

#### Recommended Options:

**Azure CNI Overlay (Recommended)**
- Conserves VNet IP address space by using logically separate CIDR ranges for pods
- Supports maximum cluster scale (5000 nodes and 250 pods per node)
- Simple IP address management
- Best choice for most scenarios

**Azure CNI Pod Subnet**
- Pods get full VNet connectivity and can be directly reached via their private IP address
- Requires larger, non-fragmented VNet IP address space
- Choose this if you need direct external access to pod IPs

#### Legacy Options (Not Recommended for New Deployments):

**Azure CNI Node Subnet (Legacy)**
- Limited scale and inefficient use of VNet IPs
- Only recommended if you specifically need a managed VNet for your cluster, see [AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)](/azure/aks/concepts-network-legacy-cni)

**Kubenet (Retiring)**
- Being retired March 31, 2028. For more information, see [AKS use Kubenet](/azure/aks/configure-kubenet).
- Limited scale and requires manual route management
- Plan to migrate to Azure CNI Overlay before the retirement date

For detailed information on networking models, see [Azure Kubernetes Service CNI networking overview](/azure/aks/concepts-network-cni-overview).

### Determine the network architecture for interconnectivity of AKS and Azure Managed Lustre

Azure Managed Lustre operates within a private virtual network. Your AKS instance must have network connectivity to the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network. There are two common ways to configure the networking between Azure Managed Lustre and AKS:

- Install AKS in its own virtual network and create a virtual network peering with the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.
- Use the **Bring your own Azure virtual network** option in AKS to install AKS in a new subnet on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend that you install AKS in the same subnet as Azure Managed Lustre.

#### Peering AKS and Azure Managed Lustre virtual networks

The option to peer two virtual networks has the advantage of separating the management of the networks into different privileged roles. Peering can also provide additional flexibility, because you can implement it across Azure subscriptions or regions. Virtual network peering requires coordination between the two networks to avoid choosing conflicting IP network spaces.

![Diagram that shows two virtual networks, one for Azure Managed Lustre and one for AKS, with a peering arrow connecting them.](media/use-csi-driver-kubernetes/subnet-access-option-2.png)

#### Installing AKS in a subnet on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network

The option to install the AKS cluster in the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network with the **Bring your own Azure virtual network** feature in AKS can be advantageous in scenarios where the network is managed singularly. You'll need to create an additional subnet, sized to meet your AKS networking requirements, in the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.

There is no privilege separation for network management when you're provisioning AKS on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network. The AKS service principal needs privileges on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.

![Diagram that shows an Azure Managed Lustre virtual network with two subnets, one for the Lustre file system and one for AKS.](media/use-csi-driver-kubernetes/subnet-access-option-1.png)

## Provisioning Methods

The Azure Lustre CSI Driver supports two provisioning methods:

### Dynamic Provisioning (Available in v0.3.0+)
Dynamic provisioning allows the CSI driver to automatically create Azure Managed Lustre file systems on-demand when persistent volume claims are created.

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic provisioning is available starting with Azure Lustre CSI Driver version 0.3.0 and is currently in Public Preview. For more information, see the [v0.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

### Static Provisioning
Static provisioning uses an existing Azure Managed Lustre file system. This method involves:
- Creating storage classes that reference existing Lustre clusters
- Manually specifying the Lustre file system name and MGS IP address
- Suitable for scenarios where you have preexisting Lustre infrastructure

Choose the method that best fits your use case. Dynamic provisioning is documented first below, followed by static provisioning instructions.

## Dynamic Provisioning (Public Preview)

**Public Preview Notice**: Dynamic provisioning functionality is currently in public preview. Some features may not be supported or may have constrained capabilities.

Dynamic provisioning automatically creates Azure Managed Lustre file systems on-demand when persistent volume claims are created. This feature became available in CSI driver version 0.3.0.

### Prerequisites for dynamic provisioning

#### Permissions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using this CSI driver to dynamically create Azure Managed Lustre clusters, the kubelet identity must have the correct permissions granted to it.

The kubelet identity requires the following permissions:
- Read and write access to the resource group where clusters will be created
- Network permissions to create and manage subnets if needed
- Azure Managed Lustre service permissions

For detailed permission requirements, see the [Driver Parameters documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/driver-parameters.md#Permissions%20For%20Kubelet%20Identity).

#### Network requirements

- An existing virtual network and subnet for the Azure Managed Lustre cluster
- Sufficient IP addresses available in the subnet for the cluster
- Proper network security group rules to allow Lustre traffic

### Create an AKS cluster for dynamic provisioning

If you haven't already created your AKS cluster, create a cluster deployment. See [Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by using the Azure portal](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a virtual network peering for dynamic provisioning

> [!NOTE]
> Skip this network peering step if you installed AKS in a subnet on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.

The AKS virtual network is created in a separate resource group from the AKS cluster's resource group. You can find the name of this resource group by going to your AKS cluster in the Azure portal, going to **Properties**, and finding the **Infrastructure** resource group. This resource group contains the virtual network that needs to be paired with the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network. It matches the pattern **MC\_\<aks-rg-name\>\_\<aks-cluster-name\>\_\<region\>**.

To peer the AKS virtual network with your Azure Managed Lustre virtual network, consult [Virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

> [!TIP]
> Due to the naming of the MC_ resource groups and virtual networks, names of networks can be similar or the same across multiple AKS deployments. When you're setting up peering, be careful to choose the AKS networks that you intend to choose.

### Connect to the AKS cluster for dynamic provisioning

1. Open a terminal session with access to the Azure CLI tools and sign in to your Azure account:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. Sign in to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Find your AKS cluster. On the **Overview** pane, select the **Connect** button, and then copy the command for **Download cluster credentials**.

1. In your terminal session, paste in the command to download the credentials. The command is similar to:

   ```azurecli
   az aks get-credentials --subscription <AKS_subscription_id> --resource_group <AKS_resource_group_name> --name <name_of_AKS>
   ```

1. Install kubectl if it's not present in your environment:

   ```azurecli
   az aks install-cli
   ```

1. Verify that the current context is the AKS cluster where you just installed the credentials and that you can connect to it:

   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true
   ```

### Install the driver for dynamic provisioning

To install the Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes, run the following command:

```bash
curl -skSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/main/deploy/install-driver.sh | bash
```

To get sample commands for a local installation, see [Install the Azure Lustre CSI driver on a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/install-csi-driver.md).

### Create a Storage Class for dynamic provisioning

Create a file called `storageclass_dynprov_lustre.yaml` and copy in the following YAML. Edit the parameters as needed for your environment:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: azurelustre-dynprov
provisioner: azurelustre.csi.azure.com
parameters:
  sku-name: "AMLFS-Durable-Premium-125"  # Choose appropriate SKU
  zone: "1"  # Specify zone if required for your SKU/location
  maintenance-day-of-week: "Sunday"
  maintenance-time-of-day-utc: "22:00"
  location: "eastus"  # Optional: defaults to AKS cluster location
  resource-group: "my-resource-group"  # Optional: defaults to AKS cluster RG
  vnet-name: "my-vnet"  # Optional: defaults to AKS cluster VNET
  subnet-name: "my-subnet"  # Optional: defaults to AKS cluster subnet
reclaimPolicy: Delete  # Change to "Retain" to keep clusters after PVC deletion
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
---
# Optional: Resource quota to limit number of clusters
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: pvc-lustre-dynprov-quota
spec:
  hard:
    azurelustre-dynprov.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/persistentvolumeclaims: "1"
```

Apply the Storage Class to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f storageclass_dynprov_lustre.yaml
```

### Create a Persistent Volume Claim for dynamic provisioning

Create a file called `pvc_storageclass_dynprov.yaml` and copy in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-lustre-dynprov
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: azurelustre-dynprov
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 48Ti  # Minimum size for AMLFS-Durable-Premium-125
```

Apply the PVC to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pvc_storageclass_dynprov.yaml
```

### Monitor cluster creation

The Azure Managed Lustre cluster creation may take 10 minutes or more. You can monitor the progress:

```bash
kubectl describe pvc pvc-lustre-dynprov
```

While creating, the status will be `Pending` with a message like:
`Waiting for a volume to be created either by the external provisioner 'azurelustre.csi.azure.com'...`

Once ready, it will have a `Bound` status with a success message.

### Create a pod for dynamic provisioning

Create a file called `pod_echo_date_dynprov.yaml` and copy in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lustre-echo-date-dynprov
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
    name: lustre-echo-date-dynprov
    command:
      - "/bin/sh"
      - "-c"
      - "while true; do echo $(date) >> /mnt/lustre/outfile; sleep 1; done"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: lustre-storage
      mountPath: /mnt/lustre
  volumes:
  - name: lustre-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-lustre-dynprov
```

Apply the pod to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod_echo_date_dynprov.yaml
```

### Verify dynamic provisioning

After the pod is running, you can verify that the dynamically created Azure Managed Lustre file system is mounted correctly:

```bash
kubectl exec -it lustre-echo-date-dynprov -- df -h
```

You should see the Azure Managed Lustre file system mounted at `/mnt/lustre`.

### Clean up dynamic resources

To delete the dynamically created resources:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc pvc-lustre-dynprov
```

If the storage class has `reclaimPolicy: Delete`, this will also delete the Azure Managed Lustre cluster. If set to `Retain`, you must delete the cluster manually when no longer needed.

## Static Provisioning

Static provisioning allows you to use an existing Azure Managed Lustre file system with your AKS cluster by manually creating the necessary Kubernetes resources.

### Prerequisites for static provisioning

- An existing Azure Managed Lustre file system. For more information on creating an Azure Managed Lustre file system, see [Create an Azure Managed Lustre file system](create-file-system-portal.md).
- The MGS IP address and internal file system name from your Azure Managed Lustre cluster

### Create an Azure Managed Lustre file system cluster for static provisioning

If you haven't already created your Azure Managed Lustre file system cluster, create the cluster now. For instructions, see [Create an Azure Managed Lustre file system by using the Azure portal](create-file-system-portal.md). Static provisioning requires an existing Azure Managed Lustre file system.

### Create an AKS cluster for static provisioning

If you haven't already created your AKS cluster, create a cluster deployment. See [Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by using the Azure portal](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a virtual network peering for static provisioning

> [!NOTE]
> Skip this network peering step if you installed AKS in a subnet on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network.

The AKS virtual network is created in a separate resource group from the AKS cluster's resource group. You can find the name of this resource group by going to your AKS cluster in the Azure portal, going to **Properties**, and finding the **Infrastructure** resource group. This resource group contains the virtual network that needs to be paired with the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network. It matches the pattern **MC\_\<aks-rg-name\>\_\<aks-cluster-name\>\_\<region\>**.

To peer the AKS virtual network with your Azure Managed Lustre virtual network, consult [Virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

> [!TIP]
> Due to the naming of the MC_ resource groups and virtual networks, names of networks can be similar or the same across multiple AKS deployments. When you're setting up peering, be careful to choose the AKS networks that you intend to choose.

### Connect to the AKS cluster for static provisioning

1. Open a terminal session with access to the Azure CLI tools and sign in to your Azure account:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. Sign in to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Find your AKS cluster. On the **Overview** pane, select the **Connect** button, and then copy the command for **Download cluster credentials**.

1. In your terminal session, paste in the command to download the credentials. The command is similar to:

   ```azurecli
   az aks get-credentials --subscription <AKS_subscription_id> --resource_group <AKS_resource_group_name> --name <name_of_AKS>
   ```

1. Install kubectl if it's not present in your environment:

   ```azurecli
   az aks install-cli
   ```

1. Verify that the current context is the AKS cluster where you just installed the credentials and that you can connect to it:

   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true
   ```

### Install the driver for static provisioning

To install the Azure Lustre CSI Driver for Kubernetes, run the following command:

```bash
curl -skSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/main/deploy/install-driver.sh | bash
```

To get sample commands for a local installation, see [Install the Azure Lustre CSI driver on a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/install-csi-driver.md).

### Create and configure a persistent volume for static provisioning

To create a persistent volume for an existing Azure Managed Lustre file system:

1. Copy the following configuration files from the **/docs/examples/** folder in the [azurelustre-csi-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/tree/main/docs/examples) repository. If you cloned the repository when you [installed the driver](#install-the-driver-for-static-provisioning), you have local copies available already.

   - **storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml**
   - **pvc_storageclass.yaml**

   If you don't want to clone the entire repository, you can download each file individually. Open each of the following links, copy the file's contents, and then paste the contents into a local file with the same file name.

   - [storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/examples/storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml)
   - [pvc_storageclass.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/examples/pvc_storageclass.yaml)

1. In the **storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml** file, update the internal name of the Lustre cluster and the Lustre Management Service (MGS) IP address.

   ![Screenshot of the storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml file with values to replace highlighted.](media/use-csi-driver-kubernetes/storageclass-values-highlighted.png)

   Both settings are displayed in the Azure portal, on the **Client connection** pane for your Azure Managed Lustre file system.

   ![Screenshot of the pane for client connection in the Azure portal. The MGS IP address and the "lustrefs" name in the mount command are highlighted.](media/use-csi-driver-kubernetes/portal-mount-values-highlighted.png)

   Make these updates:

   - Replace `EXISTING_LUSTRE_FS_NAME` with the system-assigned internal name of the Lustre cluster in your Azure Managed Lustre file system. The internal name is usually `lustrefs`. The internal name isn't the name that you gave the file system when you created it.

     The suggested `mount` command includes the name highlighted in the following address string.

     ![Screenshot of a sample address string on the pane for client connection. The internal name of the Lustre cluster is highlighted.](media/use-csi-driver-kubernetes/portal-mount-address-string.png)

   - Replace `EXISTING_LUSTRE_IP_ADDRESS` with the MGS IP address.

1. To create the storage class and the persistent volume claim, run the following `kubectl` command:

   ```bash
   kubectl create -f storageclass_existing_lustre.yaml
   kubectl create -f pvc_storageclass.yaml
   ```

### Create a pod for static provisioning

Create a pod that uses the PVC to mount the Azure Managed Lustre file system.

Create a file called `pod_echo_date.yaml` and copy in the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lustre-echo-date
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
    name: lustre-echo-date
    command:
      - "/bin/sh"
      - "-c"
      - "while true; do echo $(date) >> /mnt/lustre/outfile; sleep 1; done"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: lustre-storage
      mountPath: /mnt/lustre
  volumes:
  - name: lustre-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-lustre
```

Apply the pod to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod_echo_date.yaml
```

### Verify static provisioning

After the pod is running, you can verify that the Azure Managed Lustre file system is mounted correctly:

```bash
kubectl exec -it lustre-echo-date -- df -h
```

You should see the Azure Managed Lustre file system mounted at `/mnt/lustre`.

To view timestamps in the console during writes, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs -f lustre-echo-date
```

### Clean up static resources

To clean up resources when you're done:

```bash
kubectl delete pod lustre-echo-date
kubectl delete pvc pvc-lustre
kubectl delete storageclass azurelustre-static
```

> [!Important]
> This only deletes the Kubernetes resources. The Azure Managed Lustre file system itself will continue to exist and can be reused.

## Validate Container Image Signatures

Azure Lustre CSI Driver signs its container images to allow users to verify the integrity and origin of the images they use. Signing utilizes a public/private key pair to prove that Microsoft built a container image by creating a digital signature and adding it to the image. This section provides the steps to verify that an image was signed by Microsoft.

### Understanding Image Security in Kubernetes System Components

Container images used by the Azure Lustre CSI Driver are deployed in the `kube-system` namespace, which is considered a trusted system namespace in Kubernetes. For security and operational reasons, image integrity policies are typically not enforced on system namespaces because:

- **Bootstrap Requirements**: System components like CSI drivers must start before policy enforcement systems (like Gatekeeper and Ratify) are available
- **Trusted Components**: Images in `kube-system` are core Kubernetes infrastructure components managed by trusted providers
- **Operational Stability**: Enforcing policies on policy enforcement components themselves could prevent cluster functionality

However, you can still verify the integrity of CSI driver images before deployment.

### Pre-Deployment Image Verification

Before deploying the Azure Lustre CSI Driver, you can verify the digital signatures and authenticity of the container images using Microsoft's public signing certificates:

#### Verify Image Signatures with Notation CLI

1. **Download Notation CLI**:

    ```bash
    export NOTATION_VERSION=1.3.2
    curl -LO https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/download/v$NOTATION_VERSION/notation_$NOTATION_VERSION\_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo tar xvzf notation_$NOTATION_VERSION\_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/bin/ notation
    ```

2. **Download the Microsoft signing public certificate**: 

    ```bash
    curl -sSL "https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/Microsoft%20Supply%20Chain%20RSA%20Root%20CA%202022.crt" -o msft_signing_cert.crt
    ```

3. **Add the certificate to notation CLI**:

    ```bash
    notation cert add --type ca --store supplychain msft_signing_cert.crt
    ```

4. **Check the certificate in notation**:

    ```bash
    notation cert ls
    ```

    The output of the command looks like the following example:

    ```output
    STORE TYPE  STORE NAME  CERTIFICATE 
    ca          supplychain msft_signing_cert.crt
    ```

5. **Create a trustpolicy file for Azure Lustre CSI Driver images**:

    Create a file called `trustpolicy.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "trustPolicies": [
            {
                "name": "supplychain",
                "registryScopes": [ "*" ],
                "signatureVerification": {
                    "level" : "strict" 
                },
                "trustStores": [ "ca:supplychain" ],
                "trustedIdentities": [
                    "x509.subject: CN=Microsoft SCD Products RSA Signing,O=Microsoft Corporation,L=Redmond,ST=Washington,C=US"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

6. **Use notation to verify Azure Lustre CSI Driver images**:

    ```bash
    notation policy import trustpolicy.json
    export NOTATION_EXPERIMENTAL=1
    
    # Verify the controller image
    notation verify --allow-referrers-api mcr.microsoft.com/oss/v2/kubernetes-csi/azurelustre-csi:v0.3.0
    ```

    The output of a successful verification looks like the following example:

    ```output
    Successfully verified signature for mcr.microsoft.com/oss/v2/kubernetes-csi/azurelustre-csi@sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
    ```

### Application Workload Image Integrity

For enhanced security in production environments, consider enabling AKS Image Integrity to automatically validate container image signatures for your application workloads. While CSI driver images in the `kube-system` namespace are typically excluded from policy enforcement, you can configure image integrity policies for your application namespaces.

To learn more about implementing image integrity policies for your application workloads, see [Image Integrity in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/image-integrity).


## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting issues with the Azure Lustre CSI Driver, see the [CSI driver troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver/blob/main/docs/csi-debug.md) in the GitHub repository.

Common issues include:
- **Network connectivity problems** between AKS and Azure Managed Lustre - verify virtual network peering or subnet configuration
- **Incorrect configuration** - double-check the MGS IP address and file system name in your storage class configuration
- **Pod scheduling issues** - ensure you're using Ubuntu Linux OS SKU for node pools, as this is the only supported configuration
- **Permission issues** - verify that the AKS service principal has appropriate permissions on the Azure Managed Lustre virtual network

For dynamic provisioning specific issues:
- **Authentication/authorization errors** - verify kubelet identity permissions for creating Azure Managed Lustre clusters
- **SKU and zone validation errors** - ensure the specified SKU is supported in your region and zone configuration is correct
- **Network IP address availability** - confirm sufficient IP addresses are available in the target subnet
- **Quota limitations** - check both Kubernetes resource quotas and Azure subscription quotas for Azure Managed Lustre clusters

For additional troubleshooting resources, see:
- [Azure Managed Lustre troubleshooting](troubleshoot-deployment.md)
- [Azure Lustre CSI Driver GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurelustre-csi-driver)
