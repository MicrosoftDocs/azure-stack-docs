This section shows queries that you can enter in the **Log search** bar to help you monitor your Managed Lustre file system.

- **Aggregate operations query**: List all the UnsuspendAmlFilesystem requests for a given time duration.

    ```kusto
    AFSAuditLogs
    // The OperationName below can be replaced by obtain other operations such as "RebootAmlFilesystemNode" or "AmlFSRefreshHSMToken".
    | where OperationName has "UnsuspendAmlFilesystem"
    | project TimeGenerated, _ResourceId, ActivityId, ResultSignature, ResultDescription, Location
    | sort by TimeGenerated asc
    | limit 100
    ```

- **Unauthorized requests query**: Count of failed AMLFilesystems requests due to unauthorized access.

    ```kusto
    AFSAuditLogs
    // 401 below could be replaced by other result signatures to obtain different operation results.
    // For example, 'ResultSignature == 202' to obtain accepted requests.
    | where ResultSignature == 401
    | summarize count() by _ResourceId, OperationName
    ```
