# Scale the node count in an Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI cluster

If the resource needs of your applications change, you can manually scale an AKS cluster to run a different number of control plane nodes and worker nodes. To do this, you must scale the control plane nodes and worker nodes separately.

## Scale the control plane nodes

Use the [Set-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/set-akshcicluster.md) command to scale the control plane nodes. The following example scales the control plane nodes in a cluster named *mycluster* to three nodes. 

```powershell
Set-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -controlPlaneNodeCount 3
```

## Scale the worker nodes in the node pool

Use the [Set-AksHciNodePool](./reference/ps/set-akshcinodepool.md) command to scale the node pool. The following example scales a node pool called *linuxnodepool* in a cluster named *mycluster* to a node count of 3. 

```powershell
Set-AksHciNodePool -clustername mycluster -name linuxnodepool -count 3
``` 

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to manually scale an Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI cluster to increase or decrease the number of control plane nodes and worker nodes. Next, you can:
- [Deploy a Linux applications on a Kubernetes cluster](./deploy-linux-application.md).
- [Deploy a Windows Server application on a Kubernetes cluster](./deploy-windows-application.md).
