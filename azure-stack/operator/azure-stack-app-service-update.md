# Update Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

[!INCLUDE [Azure Stack Hub update reminder](../includes/app-service-hub-update-banner.md)]

In this article, you learn how to upgrade the [Azure App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-overview.md) deployed in an Azure Stack Hub environment that is connected or disconnected from the Internet and, secured by Entra ID or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the upgrade, you must complete [deployment of Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub](./azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md). 

## Run the App Service resource provider installer

To upgrade the App Service resource provider in an Azure Stack Hub environment, you must complete these tasks:

1. Download the Azure App Service Installer
2. Download the Azure App Service Installer Offline Package
3. Run the App Service installer (appservice.exe) and complete the upgrade.

During this process, the upgrade will:

* Detect prior deployment of App Service
* Upload to Storage
* Upgrade all App Service roles (Controllers, Management, Front-End, Publisher, and Worker roles)
* Update App Service scale set definitions
* Update App Service Resource Provider Manifest

## Complete the upgrade of App Service on Azure Stack Hub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure App Service installer must be run on a machine, which can reach the Azure Stack Hub Administrator Azure Resource Manager Endpoint.

# [Azure App Service on Azure Stack 2022 H1](#tab/22h1)

1. Run appservice.exe as an administrator.

1. Browse to the location of the offline upgrade package you previously downloaded and then select **Next**.

1. Review and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms and then select **Next**.

1. Review and accept the third-party license terms and then select **Next**.

1. Make sure that the Azure Stack Hub Azure Resource Manager endpoint and Active Directory Tenant information is correct. If you used the default settings during Azure Stack Development Kit deployment, you can accept the default values here. However, if you customized the options when you deployed Azure Stack Hub, you must edit the values in this window. For example, if you use the domain suffix *mycloud.com*, your Azure Stack Hub Azure Resource Manager endpoint must change to *management.region.mycloud.com*. After you confirm your information, select **Next**.

1. On the next page:

   1. Select the connection method you wish to use - **Credential** or **Service Principal**
        - **Credential**
            - If you're using Microsoft Entra ID, enter the Microsoft Entra admin account, and password that you provided when you deployed Azure Stack Hub. Select **Connect**.
            - If you're using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), provide your admin account. For example, cloudadmin@azurestack.local. Enter your password, and then select **Connect**.
        - **Service Principal**
            - The service principal that you use **must** have **Owner** rights on the **Default Provider Subscription**
            - Provide the **Service Principal ID**, **Certificate File**, and **Password** and select **Connect**.

   1. In **Azure Stack Hub Subscriptions**, select the **Default Provider Subscription**. Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub **must** be deployed in the **Default Provider Subscription**.

   1. In the **Azure Stack Hub Locations**, select the location that corresponds to the region you're deploying to. For example, select **local** if you're deploying to the Azure Stack Deployment Kit.

   1. If an existing App Service deployment is detected, then the resource group and storage account will be populated and greyed out.

   1. **NEW**: Administrators can specify a three character **Deployment Prefix** for the individual instances in each Virtual Machine Scale Set that are deployed. The Deployment Prefix is useful if managing multiple Azure Stack Hub instances.

      ![Screenshot showing Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub installation detected.][9]

1. In the next screen, you'll see the results of a status check performed against the App Service Resource Provider. This status check was added to verify the deployment is in the correct state to be upgraded. The status check verifies that all roles are ready, all worker tiers are valid, all virtual machine scale sets are healthy and verifies access to the App Service secrets.

1. The Platform Image and SKU screen, gives Administrators the opportunity to choose the correct [Windows 2022 Platform](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#download-items-from-the-azure-marketplace) image to be used to deploy the new role instances.
    1. **Select** the correct Platform Image
