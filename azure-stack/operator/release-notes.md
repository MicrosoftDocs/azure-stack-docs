## 1910 build reference

The Azure Stack 1910 update build number is **1.1910.0.58**.

### Update type

Starting with 1908, the underlying operating system on which Azure Stack runs was updated to Windows Server 2019. This enables core fundamental enhancements, as well as the ability to bring additional capabilities to Azure Stack in the near future.

The Azure Stack 1910 update build type is **Express**.

The 1910 update package is larger in size compared to previous updates. The increased size results in longer download times. The update will remain in the **Preparing** state for a long time, and operators can expect this process to take longer than with previous updates. The expected time it takes for the 1910 update to complete is approximately 10 hours, regardless of the number of physical nodes in your Azure Stack environment. Exact update runtimes typically depend on the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware specifications. Runtimes lasting longer than the expected value are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack operators unless the update fails. This runtime approximation is specific to the 1910 update and should not be compared to other Azure Stack updates.

For more information about update build types, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack](azure-stack-updates.md).

<!-- ## What's in this update -->

<!-- The current theme (if any) of this release. -->

### What's new

<!-- What's new, also net new experiences and features. -->

- The administrator portal now shows the privileged endpoint IP addresses in the region properties menu for easier discovery. In addition, it shows the current configured time server and DNS forwarders.

- The Azure Stack health and monitoring system can now raise alerts for various hardware components if an error happens. This requires additional configuration. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Stack hardware components](azure-stack-hardware-monitoring.md).

- [Cloud-init support for Azure Stack](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init): Cloud-init is a widely used approach to customize a Linux VM as it boots for the first time. You can use cloud-init to install packages and write files, or to configure users and security. Because cloud-init is called during the initial boot process, there are no additional steps or required agents to apply your configuration. The Ubuntu images on the marketplace have been updated to support cloud-init for provisioning.

- Azure Stack now supports all Windows Azure Linux Agent versions as Azure.

- A new version of Azure Stack Admin PowerShell modules is available. <!-- For more information, see -->

- Added the **Set-AzSDefenderManualUpdate** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to configure the manual update for Windows Defender definitions in the Azure Stack infrastructure. For more information, see [Update Windows Defender Antivirus on Azure Stack](azure-stack-security-av.md).

- Added the **Get-AzSDefenderManualUpdate** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to retrieve the configuration of the manual update for Windows Defender definitions in the Azure Stack infrastructure. For more information, see [Update Windows Defender Antivirus on Azure Stack](azure-stack-security-av.md).

- Added the **Set-AzSDnsForwarder** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to change the forwarder settings of the DNS servers in Azure Stack. For more information about DNS configuration, see [Azure Stack datacenter DNS integration](azure-stack-integrate-dns.md).

- Added the **Get-AzSDnsForwarder** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to retrieve the forwarder settings of the DNS servers in Azure Stack. For more information about DNS configuration, see [Azure Stack datacenter DNS integration](azure-stack-integrate-dns.md).

- Added support for management of **Kubernetes clusters** using [AKS engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview). Starting with this update customers can deploy production Kubernetes clusters. AKS engine enables users to:
   - Manage the life-cycle of their Kubernetes clusters. They can create, update, and scale clusters.
   - Maintain their clusters using managed images produced by the AKS and the Azure Stack teams.
   - Take advantage of an Azure Resource Manager-integrated Kubernetes cloud provider that builds clusters using Azure native resources.
   - Deploy and manage their clusters in connected or disconnected Azure Stack stamps.
   - Utilize Azure hybrid features:
      *	Integration with Azure Arc (private preview coming soon)
      *	Integration with Azure Monitor for Containers (in public preview)
   - Use Windows Containers with AKS engine (in private preview).
   - Receive CSS and PG support for their deployments.

### Improvements

<!-- Changes and product improvements with tangible customer-facing value. -->

- Added auditing rule to report when an external device (for example, a USB key) is mounted to a node of the Azure Stack infrastructure. The audit log is emitted via syslog and will be displayed as **Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing: 6416|Plug and Play Events**. For more information about how to configure the syslog client, see [Syslog forwarding](azure-stack-integrate-security.md).

- Azure Stack is moving to 4096 bit RSA keys for the internal certificates. Running internal secret rotation will replace old 2048 bit certificates with 4096 bit long certificates. For more information about secret rotation in Azure Stack, see [Rotate secrets in Azure Stack](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md).

- Upgrades to the complexity of cryptographic algorithms and key strength for several internal components to comply with the Committee on National Security Systems - Policy 15 (CNSSP-15), which provides best practices for the use of public standards for secure information sharing. Among the improvements, there is AES256 for Kerberos authentication, and SHA384 for VPN encryption. For more information about CNSSP-15, see the [Committee on National Security Systems, Policies page](http://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Policies.cfm).

- As a result of the above upgrade, Azure Stack now has new default values for IPsec/IKEv2 configurations. The new default values used on the Azure Stack side are as follows:

   **IKE Phase 1 (Main Mode) parameters**

   | Property              | Value|
   |-|-|
   | IKE Version           | IKEv2 |
   |Diffie-Hellman Group   | ECP384 |
   | Authentication method | Pre-shared key |
   |Encryption & Hashing Algorithms | AES256, SHA384 |
   |SA Lifetime (Time)     | 28,800 seconds|

   **IKE Phase 2 (Quick Mode) parameters**

   | Property| Value|
   |-|-|
   |IKE Version |IKEv2 |
   |Encryption & Hashing Algorithms (Encryption)     | GCMAES256|
   |Encryption & Hashing Algorithms (Authentication) | GCMAES256|
   |SA Lifetime (Time)  | 27,000 seconds  |
   |SA Lifetime (Kilobytes) | 33,553,408     |
   |Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) | ECP384 |
   |Dead Peer Detection | Supported|

   These changes are reflected in the [default IPsec/IKE proposal](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-settings.md#ipsecike-parameters) documentation as well.

- Infrastructure backup service improves logic that calculates desired free space for backups instead of relying on a fixed threshold. The service will use the size of a backup, retention policy, reserve, and current utilization of external storage location to determine if a warning needs to be raised to the operater. 

### Changes

- When downloading marketplace items from Azure to Azure Stack, there is a new user interface that enables you to specify a version of the item, when multiple versions exist. The new UI is available in both connected and disconnected scenarios. For more information, see [Download marketplace items from Azure to Azure Stack](azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md).  

- Starting with the 1910 release, the Azure Stack system **requires** an additional /20 private internal IP space. This network is private to the Azure Stack system and can be re-used on multiple Azure Stack systems within your datacenter. While the network is private to Azure Stack, it must not overlap with a network in your datacenter. The /20 private IP space is divided into multiple networks that enable running the Azure Stack infrastructure on containers (as previously mentioned in the [1905 release notes](release-notes.md?view=azs-1905)). The goal of running the Azure Stack infrastructure in containers is to optimize utilization and enhance performance. In addition, the /20 private IP space is also used to enable ongoing efforts that will reduce required routable IP space prior to deployment.

  - Please note that the /20 input serves as a pre-requisite to the next Azure Stack update after 1910. When the next Azure Stack update after 1910 is released and an attempt is made to install it, the update will fail if you have not completed the /20 input as described below in remediation steps. An alert will be present in the admin portal until the above remediation steps have been completed. Please see the [Datacenter network integration](azure-stack-network.md#private-network) article to understand how this new private space will be consumed. 

  - Remediation steps: To remediate, follow the instructions to [open a PEP Session](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md#access-the-privileged-endpoint). Prepare a [private internal IP range](azure-stack-network.md#logical-networks) of size /20, and run the following cmdlet (only available starting with 1910) in the PEP session using the following example: `Set-AzsPrivateNetwork -UserSubnet 100.87.0.0/20`. If the operation is performed successfully, you will receive the message **Azs Internal Network range added to the config**. If successfully completed, the alert will close in the admin portal. The Azure Stack system will now be able to update to the next version.
  
- Infrastructure backup service deletes partially uploaded backup data if the external storage location runs out of capacity during the upload procedure.  

- Infrastructure backup service adds identity service to the backup payload for AAD deployments.  

- The AzureStack PowerShell Module has been updated to version 1.8.0 for the 1910 release.<br>Changes include:
   - **New DRP Admin module**: The Deployment Resource Provider (DRP) enables orchestrated deployments of resource providers to Azure Stack. These commands interact with the Azure Resource Manager layer to interact with DRP.
   - **BRP**: <br />
           - Support single role restore for Azures stack infrastructure backup. <br />
           - Add parameter `RoleName` to cmdlet `Restore-AzsBackup`.
   - **FRP**: Breaking changes for **Drive** and **Volume** resources with API version `2019-05-01`. The features are supported by Azure Stack 1910 and later: <br />
            - The value of `ID`, `Name`, `HealthStatus` and `OperationalStatus` have been changed. <br />
            - Supported new properties `FirmwareVersion`, `IsIndicationEnabled`, `Manufacturer`, and `StoragePool` for **Drive** resources. <br />
            - The properties `CanPool` and `CannotPoolReason` of **Drive** resources have been deprecated; use `OperationalStatus` instead.

### Fixes

<!-- Product fixes that came up from customer deployments worth highlighting, especially if there is an SR/ICM associated to it. -->

- Fixed an issue that prevented enforcing TLS 1.2 policy on environments deployed prior to the Azure Stack 1904 release.
- Fixed an issue where an Ubuntu 18.04 VM created with SSH authorization enabled does not allow you to use the SSH keys to sign in. 
- Removed **Reset Password** from the Virtual Machine Scale Set UI.
- Fixed an issue where deleting the load balancer from the portal did not result in the deletion of the object in the infrastructure layer.
- Fixed an issue that showed an inaccurate percentage of the Gateway Pool utilization alert on the admin portal.
- Fixed an issue where adding more than one public IP on the same NIC on a Virtual Machine resulted in internet connectivity issues. Now, a NIC with two public IPs should work as expected.

## 1908 build reference

The Azure Stack 1908 update build number is **1.1908.4.33**.

### Update type

For 1908, the underlying operating system on which Azure Stack runs has been updated to Windows Server 2019. This enables core fundamental enhancements, as well as the ability to bring additional capabilities to Azure Stack in the near future.

The Azure Stack 1908 update build type is **Full**. As a result, the 1908 update has a longer runtime than express updates like 1906 and 1907. Exact runtimes for full updates typically depend on the number of nodes that your Azure Stack instance contains, the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system's network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware configuration. The 1908 update has had the following expected runtimes in our internal testing: 4 nodes - 42 hours, 8 nodes - 50 hours, 12 nodes - 60 hours, 16 nodes - 70 hours. Update runtimes lasting longer than these expected values are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack operators unless the update fails.

For more information about update build types, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack](azure-stack-updates.md).

- Exact update runtimes typically depend on the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware configuration.
- Runtimes lasting longer than expected are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack operators unless the update fails.
- This runtime approximation is specific to the 1908 update and should not be compared to other Azure Stack updates.

## What's in this update

<!-- The current theme (if any) of this release. -->

### What's new

<!-- What's new, also net new experiences and features. -->

- General availability release of the Azure Stack diagnostic log collection service to facilitate and improve diagnostic log collection. The Azure Stack diagnostic log collection service provides a simplified way to collect and share diagnostic logs with Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS). This diagnostic log collection service provides a new user experience in the Azure Stack administrator portal that enables operators to set up the automatic upload of diagnostic logs to a storage blob when certain critical alerts are raised, or to perform the same operation on demand. For more information, see the [Diagnostic log collection](azure-stack-diagnostic-log-collection-overview.md) article.

- General availability release of the Azure Stack network infrastructure validation as a part of the Azure Stack validation tool **Test-AzureStack**. Azure Stack network infrastructure will be a part of **Test-AzureStack**, to identify if a failure occurs on the network infrastructure of Azure Stack. The test checks connectivity of the network infrastructure by bypassing the Azure Stack software-defined network. It demonstrates connectivity from a public VIP to the configured DNS forwarders, NTP servers, and identity endpoints. In addition, it checks for connectivity to Azure when using Azure AD as the identity provider, or the federated server when using ADFS. For more information, see the [Azure Stack validation tool](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md) article.

- Added an internal secret rotation procedure to rotate internal SQL TLS certificates as required during a system update.

### Improvements

<!-- Changes and product improvements with tangible customer-facing value. -->

- The Azure Stack update blade now displays a **Last Step Completed** time for active updates. This can be seen by going to the update blade and clicking on a running update. **Last Step Completed** is then available in the **Update run details** section.

- Improvements to **Start-AzureStack** and **Stop-AzureStack** operator actions. The time to start Azure Stack has been reduced by an average of 50%. The time to shut down Azure Stack has been reduced by an average of 30%. The average startup and shutdown times remain the same as the number of nodes increases in a scale-unit.

- Improved error handling for the disconnected Marketplace tool. If a download fails or partially succeeds when using **Export-AzSOfflineMarketplaceItem**, a detailed error message is displayed with more details about the error and mitigation steps, if any.

- Improved the performance of managed disk creation from a large page blob/snapshot. Previously, it triggered a timeout when creating a large disk.  

<!-- https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/details/127669774/home -->
- Improved virtual disk health check before shutting down a node to avoid unexpected virtual disk detaching.

- Improved storage of internal logs for administrator operations. This results in improved performance and reliability during administrator operations by minimizing the memory and storage consumption of internal log processes. You might also notice improved page load times of the update blade in the administrator portal. As part of this improvement, update logs older than 6 months will no longer be available in the system. If you require logs for these updates, be sure to [Download the summary](azure-stack-apply-updates.md) for all update runs older than 6 months before performing the 1907 update.

### Changes

- Azure Stack version 1907 contains a warning alert that instructs operators to be sure to update their system's OEM package to version 2.1 or later before updating to version 1908. For more information about how to apply Azure Stack OEM updates, see [Apply an Azure Stack original equipment manufacturer update](azure-stack-update-oem.md).

- Added a new outbound rule (HTTPS) to enable communication for Azure Stack diagnostic log collection service. For more information, see [Azure Stack datacenter integration - Publish endpoints](azure-stack-integrate-endpoints.md#ports-and-urls-outbound).

- The infrastructure backup service now deletes partially uploaded backups if the external storage location runs out of capacity.

- Infrastructure backups no longer include a backup of domain services data. This only applies to systems using Azure Active Directory as the identity provider.

- We now validate that an image being ingested into the **Compute -> VM images** blade is of type page blob.

- The privileged endpoint command **Set-BmcCredential** now updates the credential in the Baseboard Management Controller.

### Fixes

<!-- Product fixes that came up from customer deployments worth highlighting, especially if there is an SR/ICM associated to it. -->
- Fixed an issue in which the publisher, offer, and SKU were treated as case sensitive in a Resource Manager template: the image was not fetched for deployment unless the image parameters were the same case as that of the publisher, offer, and SKU.

<!-- https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/details/129536438/home -->
- Fixed an issue with backups failing with a **PartialSucceeded** error message, due to timeouts during backup of storage service metadata.  

- Fixed an issue in which deleting user subscriptions resulted in orphaned resources.

- Fixed an issue in which the description field was not saved when creating an offer.

- Fixed an issue in which a user with **Read only** permissions was able to create, edit, and delete resources. Now the user is only able to create resources when the **Contributor** permission is assigned. 

<!-- https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/details/127772311/home -->
- Fixed an issue in which the update fails due to a DLL file locked by the WMI provider host.

- Fixed an issue in the update service that prevented available updates from displaying in the update tile or resource provider. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4511282](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4511282/).

- Fixed an issue that could cause updates to fail due to the management plane becoming unhealthy due to a bad configuration. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4512794](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4512794/).

- Fixed an issue that prevented users from completing deployment of 3rd party images from the marketplace. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4511259](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4511259/).

- Fixed an issue that could cause VM creation from managed images to fail due to our user image manager service crashing. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4512794](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4512794/)

- Fixed an issue in which VM CRUD operations could fail due to the app gateway cache not being refreshed as expected. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4513119](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4513119/)

- Fixed an issue in the health resource provider which impacted the availability of the region and alert blades in the administrator portal. This issue was found in 1906 and fixed in hotfix [KB4512794](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4512794).

## What's in this update

<!-- The current theme (if any) of this release. -->

<!-- What's new, also net new experiences and features. -->

- Added a **Set-TLSPolicy** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to force TLS 1.2 on all the endpoints. For more information, see [Azure Stack security controls](azure-stack-security-configuration.md).

- Added a **Get-TLSPolicy** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to retrieve the applied TLS policy. For more information, see [Azure Stack security controls](azure-stack-security-configuration.md).

- Added an internal secret rotation procedure to rotate internal TLS certificates as required during a system update.

- Added a safeguard to prevent expiration of internal secrets by forcing internal secrets rotation in case a critical alert on expiring secrets is ignored. This should not be relied on as a regular operating procedure. Secrets rotation should be planned during a maintenance window. For more information, see [Azure Stack secret rotation](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md).

- Visual Studio Code is now supported with Azure Stack deployment using AD FS.

### Improvements

<!-- Changes and product improvements with tangible customer-facing value. -->

- The **Get-GraphApplication** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint now displays the thumbprint of the currently used certificate. This improves the certificate management for service principals when Azure Stack is deployed with AD FS.

- New health monitoring rules have been added to validate the availability of AD Graph and AD FS, including the ability to raise alerts.

- Improvements to the reliability of the backup resource provider when the infrastructure backup service moves to another instance.

- Performance optimization of external secret rotation procedure to provide a uniform execution time to facilitate scheduling of maintenance window.

- The **Test-AzureStack** cmdlet now reports on internal secrets that are about to expire (critical alerts).

- A new parameter is available for the **Register-CustomAdfs** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint that enables skipping the certificate revocation list checking when configuring the federation trust for AD FS.

- The 1906 release introduces greater visibility into update progress, so you can be assured that updates are not pausing. This results in an increase in the total number of update steps shown to operators in the **Update** blade. You might also notice more update steps happening in parallel than in previous updates.

#### Networking updates

- Updated lease time set in DHCP responder to be consistent with Azure.

- Improved retry rates to the resource provider in the scenario of failed deployment of resources.

- Removed the **Standard** SKU option from both the load balancer and public IP, as that is currently not supported.

### Changes

- Creating a storage account experience is now consistent with Azure.

- Changed alert triggers for expiration of internal secrets:
  - Warning alerts are now raised 90 days prior to the expiration of secrets.
  - Critical alerts are now raised 30 days prior to the expiration of secrets.

- Updated strings in infrastructure backup resource provider for consistent terminology.

### Fixes

<!-- Product fixes that came up from customer deployments worth highlighting, especially if there is an SR/ICM associated to it. -->

- Fixed an issue where resizing a managed disk VM failed with an **Internal Operation Error**.

- Fixed an issue where a failed user image creation puts the service that manages images is in a bad state; this blocks deletion of the failed image and creation of new images. This is also fixed in the 1905 hotfix.

- Active alerts on expiring internal secrets are now automatically closed after successful execution of internal secret rotation.

- Fixed an issue in which the update duration in the update history tab would trim the first digit if the update was running for more than 99 hours.

- The **Update** blade includes a **Resume** option for failed updates.

- In the administrator and user portals, fixed the issue in marketplace in which the Docker extension was incorrectly returned from search but no further action could be taken, as it is not available in Azure Stack.

- Fixed an issue in template deployment UI that does not populate parameters if the template name begins with '_' underscore.

- Fixed an issue where the virtual machine scale set creation experience provides CentOS-based 7.2 as an option for deployment. CentOS 7.2 is not available on Azure Stack. We now provide Centos 7.5 as our option for deployment

- You can now remove a scale set from the **Virtual machine scale sets** blade.
