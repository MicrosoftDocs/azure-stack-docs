## 2301 build reference

The Azure Stack Hub 2301 update build number is **1.2301.2.58**.

### Update type

The Azure Stack Hub 2301 update build type is **Full**.

The 2301 update has the following expected runtimes based on our internal testing:

- 4 nodes: 8-28 hours
- 8 nodes: 11-30 hours
- 12 nodes: 14-34 hours
- 16 nodes: 17-40 hours

Exact update durations typically depend on the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware specifications. Durations that are shorter or longer than the expected value are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack Hub operators unless the update fails. This runtime approximation is specific to the 2301 update and should not be compared to other Azure Stack Hub updates.

For more information about update build types, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-updates.md).

### What's new

- Public preview release of the [Azure Site Recovery resource provider](azure-site-recovery-overview.md) for Azure Stack Hub.
- Public preview release of [VPN Fast Path](azure-stack-vpn-fast-path-operators.md) with new VPN Gateway SKUs.
- New [VPN Fast Path documentation for Azure Stack Hub operators](azure-stack-vpn-fast-path-operators.md) and [Azure Stack Hub users](../user/azure-stack-vpn-fast-path-user.md).
- Added new VM size **Standard_E20_v3** to support larger database workloads that require more than 112 GB of memory.
- Added support for NVIDIA A100 Tensor GPU. Validate with your OEM if your hardware can support the GPU requirements.
- Added new VM series for A100. For more details, see [GPUs on Azure Stack Hub](../user/gpu-vms-about.md#nc_a100-v4).
- This update includes all the platform requirements to add [Azure Site Recovery](https://aka.ms/azshasr) on Azure Stack Hub. The first scenario we are enabling is focused on replicating VMs across two Azure Stack Hub regions. ASR on Azure Stack Hub is an Add-on RP which will have to be added through the Marketplace Management.
- Added the ability for operators to see virtual machine status information across all user subscriptions in the Azure Stack Hub admin portal.

<!-- ### Improvements -->

### Changes

- Starting with the 2301 release, [the Event Hubs resource provider](event-hubs-rp-install.md) is offered to subscriptions that have been granted access. If you want to start using this feature, or if you need to upgrade from a previous version, [open a support case](azure-stack-help-and-support-overview.md) and our support engineers will guide you through the deployment or upgrade process.
- SQL resource provider 2.0.13 and MySQL resource provider 2.0.13 are released to accommodate some UI breaking changes introduced in Azure Stack Hub 2301. Update the SQL resource provider and MySQL resource provider to the latest version before updating Azure Stack Hub. You may need to refresh the browser cache for the new UI changes to take effect.

<!-- ### Fixes -->

## Security updates

For information about security updates in this update of Azure Stack Hub, see [Azure Stack Hub security updates](release-notes-security-updates.md).

## Hotfixes

Azure Stack Hub releases hotfixes regularly. Starting with the 2005 release, when you update to a new major version (for example, 1.2008.x to 1.2102.x), the latest hotfixes (if any) in the new major version are installed automatically. From that point forward, if a hotfix is released for your build, you should install it.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Stack Hub hotfix releases are cumulative; you only need to install the latest hotfix to get all fixes included in any previous hotfix releases for that version.

For more information, see our [servicing policy](azure-stack-servicing-policy.md).

Azure Stack Hub hotfixes are only applicable to Azure Stack Hub integrated systems; do not attempt to install hotfixes on the ASDK.

### Hotfix prerequisites: before applying the 2301 update

The 2301 release of Azure Stack Hub must be applied on the 2206 release with the following hotfixes:

- [Azure Stack Hub hotfix 1.2206.2.66](hotfix-1-2206-2-66.md)

### After successfully applying the 2301 update

When you update to a new major version (for example, 1.2108.x to 1.2206.x), the latest hotfixes (if any) in the new major version are installed automatically. From that point forward, if a hotfix is released for your build, you should install it.

After the installation of 2301, if any hotfixes for 2301 are subsequently released, you should install them:

- No Azure Stack Hub hotfix for 2301.

## 2206 build reference

The Azure Stack Hub 2206 update build number is **1.2206.1.24**.

### Update type

The Azure Stack Hub 2206 update build type is **Full**.

The 2206 update has the following expected runtimes based on our internal testing:

- 4 nodes: 8-28 hours
- 8 nodes: 11-30 hours
- 12 nodes: 14-34 hours
- 16 nodes: 17-40 hours

Exact update durations typically depend on the capacity used on your system by tenant workloads, your system network connectivity (if connected to the internet), and your system hardware specifications. Durations that are shorter or longer than the expected value are not uncommon and do not require action by Azure Stack Hub operators unless the update fails. This runtime approximation is specific to the 2206 update and should not be compared to other Azure Stack Hub updates.

For more information about update build types, see [Manage updates in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-updates.md).

### What's new

- European Union-based customers can now choose to have all their data stored and processed inside the European Union boundary. For more information, see [EU Schrems II initiative for Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-security-foundations.md#eu-schrems-ii-initiative-for-azure-stack-hub).
- Azure Stack Hub now supports retrieving BitLocker keys for data encryption at rest. For more information, see [Retrieving BitLocker recovery keys](azure-stack-security-bitlocker.md#retrieving-bitlocker-recovery-keys).

<!-- ### Improvements -->

### Changes

- SQL RP V2 and MySQL RP V2 are only available to subscriptions that have been granted access. If you are still using SQL RP V1 and MySQL RP V1, it is strongly recommended that you [open a support case](azure-stack-help-and-support-overview.md) to go through the upgrade process before you upgrade to Azure Stack Hub 2206.
- This release provides support for Azure Stack Hub root certificate rotation. Previously, secret rotation did not rotate the root. You will be able to rotate the root certificate after installing the update. To do so, [perform internal secret rotation](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md#rotate-internal-secrets) on or before the next time you are notified via expiration alerts. Failure to rotate the root certificate and/or perform internal secret rotation might result in your stamp becoming unrecoverable.

### Fixes

- Fix to improve SLB throughput.
- Fixed an issue that prevented access to the storage subsystem when scale unit nodes are rebooted.

### What's new

- Azure Stack Hub operators can now configure GPU quotas for VMs.
- [Emergency VM Access](../user/emergency-vm-access.md) is now available in Azure Stack Hub without contacting Microsoft Support.
- Windows Server 2022 is now supported as a guest operating system. Windows Server 2022 VMs must be manually activated using [Automatic Virtual Machine Activation](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation) in Windows Server on Azure Stack Hub running version 2108 or later. It cannot be activated on previous versions.
- Starting with this version, if proactive log collection is disabled, logs are captured and stored locally for proactive failure events. The local logs can only be accessed by Microsoft in the context of a support case. New alerts have been added to the proactive log collection **Alert** library.
- Two new services, [Azure Kubernetes Service](../user/aks-overview.md) and [Azure Container Registry](../user/container-registry-overview.md), are available in public preview with this release.
- [**AzureStack** module 2.2.0](/powershell/azure/azure-stack/overview?view=azurestackps-2.2.0&preserve-view=true) is released to align with Azure Stack Hub version 2108. The version update includes changes in compute administrator module and new modules `Azs.ContainerRegistry.Admin` and `Azs.ContainerService.Admin`. For more information, see the [change log](https://github.com/Azure/azurestack-powershell/blob/release-2108/src/changelog.md).
- With this release, telemetry data is uploaded to an Azure Storage account that's managed and controlled by Microsoft. Azure Stack Hub telemetry service connects to `https://*.blob.core.windows.net/` and `https://azsdiagprdwestusfrontend.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/` for a successful telemetry data upload to Microsoft. Port 443 (HTTPS) must be opened. For more information, see [Azure Stack Hub telemetry](azure-stack-telemetry.md).
- This release includes a public preview of remote support, which enables a Microsoft support professional to solve your support case faster by permitting access to your device remotely and performing limited troubleshooting and repair. You can enable this feature by granting consent, while controlling the access level and duration of access. Support can only access your device after a support request has been submitted. For more information, see [Remote support for Azure Stack Hub](remote-support.md).

### Improvements

- When the external SMB share is almost full, the alert description has been adjusted to align with progressive backup.
- To prevent upload failures, the number of parallel infrastructure backup repository uploads to the external SMB share is now limited.
- Replaced **Node-Inaccessible-for-vm-placement** alert with alerts to distinguish between **host-unresponsive** scenarios and **hostagent-service-on-node-unresponsive** scenarios.
- App Service now has the ability to discover the default NAT IP for outbound connections.

### Changes

- Before starting the 2108 update, you must stop (deallocate) all virtual machines that use a GPU, to ensure the update can complete successfully. This applies to AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, as the underlying implementation changes to no pooled resources.
- SQL RP and MySQL RP are only available to subscriptions that have been granted access. If you want to start using these resource providers, or need to upgrade from a previous version, [open a support case](azure-stack-help-and-support-overview.md), and Microsoft support engineers can help you with the deployment or upgrade process.
- **Set-AzSLegalNotice** now triggers the appearance of a new screen that contains the caption and the text that were set when running the command. This screen appears every time a new instance of the portal is created.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue in which one repository failure when uploading to the external SMB share caused the entire infrastructure backup to fail.
- Fixed an issue that caused N series VMs with multiple GPUs to fail creation.
- Fixed an issue in which uninstalling a VM extension nulls out protected settings for existing VM extensions.
- Fixed an issue that caused internal load balancers to use external IPs.
- Fixed an issue downloading serial logs from the portal.
