# Generate certificate signing requests for Azure Stack Hub

You use the Azure Stack Hub Readiness Checker tool to create certificate signing requests (CSRs) that are suitable for an Azure Stack Hub deployment, or for renewal of certificates for an existing deployment. It's important to request, generate, and validate certificates with enough lead time to test them before they're deployed.

The tool is used to request the following certificates, based on the **Choose a CSR certificate scenario** selector at the top of this article:

- Standard certificates for a new deployment: Choose **New deployment** using the **Choose a CSR certificate scenario** selector at the top of this article.
- Renewal certificates for an existing deployment: Choose **Renewal** using the **Choose a CSR certificate scenario** selector at the top of this article.
- Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) certificates: Can optionally be generated with both standard and renewal certificates. See [Azure Stack Hub public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate requirements - optional PaaS certificates](azure-stack-pki-certs.md#optional-paas-certificates) for more details.

## Prerequisites

Before you generate CSRs for PKI certificates for an Azure Stack Hub deployment, your system must meet the following prerequisites:

- You must be on a machine with Windows 10 or later, or Windows Server 2016 or later.
- Install the [Azure Stack Hub Readiness checker tool](https://aka.ms/AzsReadinessChecker) from a PowerShell prompt (5.1 or later) using the following cmdlet:
   ```powershell  
       Install-Module Microsoft.AzureStack.ReadinessChecker -Force -AllowPrerelease
   ```
- You'll need the following attributes for your certificate:
  - Region name
  - External fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
  - Subject
::: zone pivot="csr-type-new-deployment"
## Generate CSRs for new deployment certificates

> [!NOTE]  
>
> Elevation is required to generate certificate signing requests. In restricted environments where elevation is not possible, you can use this tool to generate clear-text template files, which contain all the information that's required for Azure Stack Hub external certificates. You then need to use these template files on an elevated session to finish the public/private key pair generation. See below for more details.

To prepare CSRs for new Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates, complete the following steps:

1. Open a PowerShell session on the machine where you installed the Readiness Checker tool.
1. Declare the following variables:

    > [!NOTE]  
    > `<regionName>.<externalFQDN>` forms the basis on which all external DNS names in Azure Stack Hub are created. In the following example, the portal would be `portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com`.

    ```powershell  
    $outputDirectory = "$ENV:USERPROFILE\Documents\AzureStackCSR" # An existing output directory
    $IdentitySystem = "AAD"                     # Use "AAD" for Azure Active Director, "ADFS" for Active Directory Federation Services
    $regionName = 'east'                        # The region name for your Azure Stack Hub deployment
    $externalFQDN = 'azurestack.contoso.com'    # The external FQDN for your Azure Stack Hub deployment
    ```

Now generate the CSRs using the same PowerShell session. The instructions are specific to the **Subject** format that you select below:



# [Subject with no CN](#tab/omit-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> The first DNS name of the Azure Stack Hub service will be configured as the CN field on the certificate request.

1. Declare a subject, for example:

    ```powershell  
    $subject = "C=US,ST=Washington,L=Redmond,O=Microsoft,OU=Azure Stack Hub"
    ```
  
[!INCLUDE [generate CSRs - no CN](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs-new.md)]



# [Subject with CN](#tab/add-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> The CN you specify will be configured on every certificate request.

1. Declare a subject, for example:

    ```powershell  
    $subject = "C=US,ST=Washington,L=Redmond,O=Microsoft,OU=Azure Stack Hub,CN=NWTraders"
    ```
  
[!INCLUDE [generate CSRs - with CN](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs-new.md)]



# [Subject with only CN](#tab/only-cn)

> [!NOTE]  
> The Readiness Checker tool will generate a CN for each certificate, and no other relative distinguished names will be included in the subject.

[!INCLUDE [generate CSRs - with only CN](../includes/get-pki-certs-csrs-new-cn-only.md)]

---

Complete the final steps:

1. Review the output:

    ```powershell  
    Starting Certificate Request Process for Deployment
    CSR generating for following SAN(s): *.adminhosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.adminvault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.blob.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.hosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.queue.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.table.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.vault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminmanagement.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminportal.east.azurestack.contoso.com,management.east.azurestack.contoso.com,portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com
    Present this CSR to your Certificate Authority for Certificate Generation:  C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710165538.req
    Certreq.exe output: CertReq: Request Created
    ```

1. If the `-LowPrivilege` parameter was used, an .inf file was generated in the `C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR` subdirectory. For example:

    `C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710165538_ClearTextTemplate.inf`

    Copy the file to a system where elevation is allowed, then sign each request with `certreq` by using the following syntax: `certreq -new <example.inf> <example.req>`. Then complete the rest of the process on that elevated system, because it requires matching the new certificate that's signed by the CA with its private key, which is generated on the elevated system.
::: zone-end


::: zone pivot="csr-type-renewal"
- Your system's region and external domain name (FQDN) will be used by the Readiness Checker to determine the endpoint for extracting attributes from your existing certificates. If either of the following apply to your scenario, you must use the **Choose a CSR certificate scenario** selector at the top of this article, and pick the [New deployment](?pivots=csr-type-new-deployment) version of this article instead:
   - You want to change the attributes of certificates at the endpoint, such as subject, key length, and signature algorithm.
   - You want to use a certificate subject that contains only the common name attribute.
- Confirm that you have HTTPS connectivity for your Azure Stack Hub system before beginning.

## Generate CSRs for renewal certificates  

This section covers preparation of CSRs for renewal of existing Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates.

### Generate CSRs

1. Open a PowerShell session on the machine where you installed the Readiness Checker tool.
1. Declare the following variables:

    > [!NOTE]  
    >
    > The Readiness Checker uses `stampEndpoint` plus a prepended string to find existing certificates. For example, `portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com` is used for deployment certificates, `sso.appservices.east.azurestack.contoso.com` for app services certificates, etc.

    ```powershell
    $regionName = 'east'                                            # The region name for your Azure Stack Hub deployment
    $externalFQDN = 'azurestack.contoso.com'                        # The external FQDN for your Azure Stack Hub deployment    
    $stampEndpoint = "$regionName.$externalFQDN"
    $outputDirectory = "$ENV:USERPROFILE\Documents\AzureStackCSR"   # Declare the path to an existing output directory
    ```

1. Generate CSRs by completing one or more of the following:

   - For a **production environment**, the first script will generate CSRs for deployment certificates:

     ```powershell  
     New-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory
     ```

   - The second script, if desired, uses the `-IncludeContainerRegistry` and will generate a CSR for Azure Container Registry at the same time as CSRs for deployment certificates:

      ```powershell
      New-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory -IncludeContainerRegistry
      ```

   - The third script will generate CSRs for any optional PaaS services you've installed:


     ```powershell  
     # App Services
     New-AzsHubAppServicesCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory

     # DBAdapter
     New-AzsHubDBAdapterCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory

     # EventHubs
     New-AzsHubEventHubsCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory

     # Azure Container Registry
     New-AzsHubAzureContainerRegistryCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory 
     ```

   - For a **development and test environment**, to generate a single CSR with multiple-subject alternative names, add the `-RequestType SingleCSR` parameter and value.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > We do *not* recommend using this approach for production environments.

     ```powershell  
     New-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateSigningRequest -StampEndpoint $stampEndpoint -OutputRequestPath $OutputDirectory -RequestType SingleCSR
     ```

1. Review the output:

    ```powershell  
    Querying StampEndpoint portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com for existing certificate
    Starting Certificate Request Process for Deployment
    CSR generating for following SAN(s): *.adminhosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.adminvault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.blob.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.hosting.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.queue.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.table.east.azurestack.contoso.com,*.vault.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminmanagement.east.azurestack.contoso.com,adminportal.east.azurestack.contoso.com,management.east.azurestack.contoso.com,portal.east.azurestack.contoso.com
    Present this CSR to your certificate authority for certificate generation: C:\Users\username\Documents\AzureStackCSR\Deployment_east_azurestack_contoso_com_SingleCSR_CertRequest_20200710122723.req
    Certreq.exe output: CertReq: Request Created
    ```
::: zone-end

When you're ready, submit the generated .req file to your CA (either internal or public). The directory specified by the `$outputDirectory` variable contains the CSRs that must be submitted to a CA. The directory also contains, for your reference, a child directory containing the .inf files to be used during certificate request generation. Be sure that your CA generates certificates by using a generated request that meets the [Azure Stack Hub PKI requirements](azure-stack-pki-certs.md).

## Next steps

Once you receive your certificates back from your certificate authority, follow the steps in [Prepare Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates](azure-stack-prepare-pki-certs.md) on the same system.
