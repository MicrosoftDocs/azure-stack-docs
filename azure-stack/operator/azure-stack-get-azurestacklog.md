# Send Azure Stack Hub diagnostic logs by using the privileged endpoint (PEP)

<!--how do you look up the PEP IP address. You look up the azurestackstampinfo.json--->

To run Get-AzureStackLog on an integrated system, you need to have access to the privileged endpoint (PEP). Here's an example script you can run using the PEP to collect logs. If you are canceling a running log collection to start a new one, please wait 5 minutes Before starting new log collection and enter `Remove-PSSession -Session $session`.


```powershell
$ipAddress = "<IP ADDRESS OF THE PEP VM>" # You can also use the machine name instead of IP here.

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "<CLOUD ADMIN PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN NAME>\CloudAdmin", $password)

$shareCred = Get-Credential

$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $ipAddress -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $cred -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

$fromDate = (Get-Date).AddHours(-8)
$toDate = (Get-Date).AddHours(-2) # Provide the time that includes the period for your issue

Invoke-Command -Session $session { Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<EXTERNAL SHARE ADDRESS>" -OutputShareCredential $using:shareCred -FilterByRole Storage -FromDate $using:fromDate -ToDate $using:toDate}

if ($session) {
    Remove-PSSession -Session $session
}
```

### Examples

* Collect all logs for all roles:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred
  ```

* Collect logs from VirtualMachines and BareMetal roles:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred -FilterByRole VirtualMachines,BareMetal
  ```

* Collect logs from VirtualMachines and BareMetal roles, with date filtering for log files for the past 8 hours:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred -FilterByRole VirtualMachines,BareMetal -FromDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-8)
  ```

* Collect logs from VirtualMachines and BareMetal roles, with date filtering for log files for the time period between 8 hours ago and 2 hours ago:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred -FilterByRole VirtualMachines,BareMetal -FromDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-8) -ToDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-2)
  ```

* Collect logs from tenant deployments running self-managed Kubernetes clusters (AKS engine) on Azure Stack. Kubernetes logs should be stored in a tenant storage account in a format that will enable the collection time range to be applied to them as well. 

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputPath <Path> -InputSasUri "<Blob Service Sas URI>" -FromDate "<Beginning of the time range>" -ToDate "<End of the time range>"
  ```

  For example:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputPath C:\KubernetesLogs -InputSasUri "https://<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName><SAS token>" -FromDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-8) -ToDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-2) 
  ```

* Collect logs for the value-add RPs. The general syntax is:
 
  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByResourceProvider <<value-add RP name>>
  ```
  
  ::: moniker range=">= azs-2008"

  To collect logs for SQL RP: 

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByResourceProvider SQLAdapter
  ```

  To collect logs for MySQL RP: 

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByResourceProvider MySQLAdapter
  ```
  
  ::: moniker-end
 
  To collect logs for Event Hubs:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByResourceProvider eventhub
  ```
 
  To collect logs for Azure Stack Edge:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByResourceProvide databoxedge
  ```

* Collect logs and store them in the specified Azure Storage blob container. The general syntax for this operation is as follows:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSasUri "<Blob service SAS Uri>"
  ```

  For example:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSasUri "https://<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName><SAS token>"
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > This procedure is useful for uploading logs. Even if you don't have an SMB share accessible or internet access, you can create a blob storage account on your Azure Stack Hub to transfer the logs, and then use your client to retrieve those logs.  

  To generate the SAS token for the storage account, the following permissions are required:

  * Access to the Blob Storage service.
  * Access to the container resource type.

  To generate a SAS Uri value to be used for the `-OutputSasUri` parameter, follow these steps:

  1. Create a storage account, following the steps [in this article](/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account).
  2. Open an instance of the Azure Storage Explorer.
  3. Connect to the storage account created in step 1.
  4. Navigate to **Blob Containers** in **Storage Services**.
  5. Select **Create a new container**.
  6. Right-click the new container, then click **Get Shared Access Signature**.
  7. Select a valid **Start Time** and **End Time**, depending on your requirements.
  8. For the required permissions, select **Read**, **Write**, and **List**.
  9. Select **Create**.
  10. You'll get a Shared Access Signature. Copy the URL portion and provide it to the `-OutputSasUri` parameter.

### Parameter considerations

* The parameters **OutputSharePath** and **OutputShareCredential** are used to store logs in a user specified location.
* The **FromDate** and **ToDate** parameters can be used to collect logs for a particular time period. If these parameters aren't specified, logs are collected for the past four hours by default.
* Use the **FilterByNode** parameter to filter logs by computer name. For example:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred -FilterByNode azs-xrp01
    ```

* Use the **FilterByLogType** parameter to filter logs by type. You can choose to filter by File, Share, or WindowsEvent. For example:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred -FilterByLogType File
    ```

* You can use the **TimeOutInMinutes** parameter to set the timeout for log collection. It's set to 150 (2.5 hours) by default.
* Dump file log collection is disabled by default. To enable it, use the **IncludeDumpFile** switch parameter.
* Currently, you can use the **FilterByRole** parameter to filter log collection by the following roles:

### Additional considerations on diagnostic logs

* The command takes some time to run based on which role(s) the logs are collecting. Contributing factors also include the time duration specified for log collection, and the numbers of nodes in the Azure Stack Hub environment.
* As log collection runs, check the new folder created in the **OutputSharePath** parameter specified in the command.
* Each role has its logs inside individual zip files. Depending on the size of the collected logs, a role may have its logs split into multiple zip files. For such a role, if you want to have all the log files unzipped into a single folder, use a tool that can unzip in bulk. Select all the zipped files for the role and select **extract here**. All the log files for that role will be unzipped into a single merged folder.
* A file called **Get-AzureStackLog_Output.log** is also created in the folder that contains the zipped log files. This file is a log of the command output, which can be used for troubleshooting problems during log collection. Sometimes the log file includes `PS>TerminatingError` entries which can be safely ignored, unless expected log files are missing after log collection runs.
* To investigate a specific failure, logs may be needed from more than one component.

  * System and event logs for all infrastructure VMs are collected in the **VirtualMachines** role.
  * System and event logs for all hosts are collected in the **BareMetal** role.
  * Failover cluster and Hyper-V event logs are collected in the **Storage** role.
  * ACS logs are collected in the **Storage** and **ACS** roles.

> [!NOTE]
> Size and age limits are enforced on the logs collected as it's essential to ensure efficient utilization of your storage space and to avoid getting flooded with logs. However, when diagnosing a problem, you sometimes need logs that don't exist anymore because of these limits. Thus, it's **highly recommended** that you offload your logs to an external storage space (a storage account in Azure, an additional on premises storage device, etc.) every 8 to 12 hours and keep them there for 1 - 3 months, depending on your requirements. You should also ensure this storage location is encrypted.

### Invoke-AzureStackOnDemandLog

You can use the **Invoke-AzureStackOnDemandLog** cmdlet to generate on-demand logs for certain roles (see the list at the end of this section). The logs generated by this cmdlet aren't present by default in the log bundle you receive when you execute the **Get-AzureStackLog** cmdlet. Also, it's recommended that you collect these logs only when requested by the Microsoft support team.

Currently, you can use the `-FilterByRole` parameter to filter log collection by the following roles:

* OEM
* NC
* SLB
* Gateway

#### Example of collecting on-demand diagnostic logs

```powershell
$ipAddress = "<IP ADDRESS OF THE PEP VM>" # You can also use the machine name instead of IP here.

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "<CLOUD ADMIN PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<DOMAIN NAME>\CloudAdmin", $password)

$shareCred = Get-Credential

$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $ipAddress -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $cred -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

$fromDate = (Get-Date).AddHours(-8)
$toDate = (Get-Date).AddHours(-2) # Provide the time that includes the period for your issue

Invoke-Command -Session $session {
   Invoke-AzureStackOnDemandLog -Generate -FilterByRole "<on-demand role name>" # Provide the supported on-demand role name e.g. OEM, NC, SLB, Gateway
   Get-AzureStackLog -OutputSharePath "<external share address>" -OutputShareCredential $using:shareCred -FilterByRole Storage -FromDate $using:fromDate -ToDate $using:toDate
}

if ($session) {
   Remove-PSSession -Session $session
}
```

### How diagnostic log collection using the PEP works

Azure Stack Hub diagnostics tools help make log collection easy and efficient. The following diagram shows how the diagnostics tools work:

![Azure Stack Hub diagnostic tools workflow diagram](media/azure-stack-diagnostics/get-azslogs.png)


#### Trace Collector

The Trace Collector is enabled by default and runs continuously in the background to collect all Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logs from Azure Stack Hub component services. ETW logs are stored in a common local share with a five-day age limit. Once this limit is reached, the oldest files are deleted as new ones are created. The default maximum size allowed for each file is 200 MB. A size check happens every 2 minutes, and if the current file is >= 200 MB, it's saved and a new file generates. There's also an 8 GB limit on the total file size generated per event session.

#### Get-AzureStackLog

The PowerShell cmdlet Get-AzureStackLog can be used to collect logs from all the components in an Azure Stack Hub environment. It saves them in zip files in a user-defined location. If the Azure Stack Hub technical support team needs your logs to help troubleshoot an issue, they may ask you to run Get-AzureStackLog.

> [!CAUTION]
> These log files may contain personally identifiable information (PII). Take this into account before you publicly post any log files.

The following are some example log types that are collected:

* **Azure Stack Hub deployment logs**
* **Windows event logs**
* **Panther logs**
* **Cluster logs**
* **Storage diagnostic logs**
* **ETW logs**

These files are collected and saved in a share by Trace Collector. Get-AzureStackLog can then be used to collect them when necessary.
