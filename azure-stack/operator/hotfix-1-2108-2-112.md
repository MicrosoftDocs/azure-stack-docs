# Azure Stack Hub hotfix 1.2108.2.112

## Summary

- Support for Azure Stack Hub root certificate rotation. Previously, secret rotation did not rotate the root. To rotate the root certificate, you must [perform internal secret rotation](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md#rotate-internal-secrets) after installing the update. Otherwise, your stamp might become unrecoverable.
