# Intent: As an Azure Stack operator, I want to use remote support to enable Microsoft support to diagnose and troubleshoot Azure Stack Hub

# Remote support for Azure Stack Hub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remote support is in public preview and only available in the following versions:
>
> - 2206
> - 2108
> - 2102 with [hotfix 1.2102.30.132](/azure-stack/operator/hotfix-1-2102-30-132) and later

Use remote support to allow a Microsoft support professional to diagnose and help speed resolution of your support request by permitting remote access to your device for limited troubleshooting and repair. You can enable this feature by granting consent for a specific access level and duration. Support can only access your device after a support request has been submitted.

Once enabled, Microsoft support gets just-in-time (JIT) limited time access to your device over a secure, audited, and compliant channel. Remote support uses protocol HTTPS over port 443. The traffic is encrypted with TLS 1.2. Operations performed are restricted based on the access level granted using [just enough administration](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/overview) (JEA).

For more information about cmdlets that Microsoft support can execute during a remote support session, see the [list of Microsoft Support operations](#list-of-microsoft-support-operations) section in this article.

## Why use remote support?

Remote support gives you the ability to:

- Improve the speed to resolution. After the initial scoping consultation with Microsoft Support, you can enable remote support. At that point Microsoft Support no longer needs to arrange meetings with you for further troubleshooting.
- Reduce the number of [privileged endpoint (PEP) session elevation](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md#unlocking-the-privileged-endpoint-for-support-scenarios) to resolve issues.
- View the detailed transcript of all executed operations at any time.
- Grant just-in-time authenticated access on an incident-by-incident basis. You can define the access level and duration for each incident.
- You can revoke consent at any time which terminates the remote session. Access is automatically disabled once the consent duration expires.

## Requirements

Remote support requires you to allow access to certain outbound ports and destination URLs. For more information on required endpoints, see [Ports and URLs (outbound)](azure-stack-integrate-endpoints.md#ports-and-urls-outbound).

### Consent

Before remote support is enabled, you must provide consent to authorize Microsoft Support to execute diagnostic or repair commands. The following text includes the data handling terms:

> By approving this request, the Microsoft support organization or the Azure engineering team supporting this feature ("Microsoft Support Engineer") will be given direct access to your device for troubleshooting purposes and/or resolving the technical issue described in the Microsoft support case.
>
> During a remote support session, a Microsoft Support Engineer may need to collect logs. By enabling remote support, you have agreed to a diagnostic logs collection by Microsoft Support Engineer to address a support case You also acknowledge and consent to the upload and retention of those logs in an Azure storage account managed and controlled by Microsoft.  These logs may be accessed by Microsoft in the context of a support case and to improve the health of Azure Stack Hub.
>
> The data will be used only to troubleshoot failures that are subject to a support ticket, and will not be used for marketing, advertising, or any other commercial purposes without your consent. The data may be retained for up to ninety (90) days and will be handled following our standard privacy practices.
>
> Any data previously collected with your consent will not be affected by the revocation of your permission.

## Remote support examples

In Azure Stack Hub, remote support can be managed using [privileged endpoint](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md) (PEP). The following example scenarios show you how to perform various operations to enable remote support access for Microsoft support.

### Enable remote support for diagnostics

In this example, you enable remote support access for diagnostic-related operations only. The consent expires in 1,440 minutes (one day) after which remote access cannot be established.

```powershell
Enable-RemoteSupport -AccessLevel Diagnostics -ExpireInMinutes 1440
```

Use **ExpireInMinutes** parameter to set the duration of the session. In the example, consent expires in 1,440 minutes (one day). After one day, remote access cannot be established.

You can set **ExpireInMinutes** a minimum duration of 60 minutes (one hour) and a maximum of 20,160 minutes (14 days).

If duration is not defined the remote session will expire in 480 (8 hours) by default.

### Enable remote support for diagnostics and repair

In this example, you enable remote support access for diagnostic and repair related operations only. Because expiration was not explicitly provided, it expires in eight hours by default.

```powershell
Enable-RemoteSupport -AccessLevel DiagnosticsRepair
```

### Retrieve existing consent grants

In this example, you retrieve any previously granted consent. The result includes expired consent in the last 30 days.

```powershell
Get-RemoteSupportAccess -IncludeExpired
```

### Revoke remote access consent

In this example, you revoke remote access consent. Any existing sessions are terminated and new sessions can no longer be established.

```powershell
Disable-RemoteSupport
```

### List existing remote sessions

In this example, you list all the remote sessions that were made to the device since *FromDate*.

```powershell
Get-RemoteSupportSessionHistory -FromDate <Date>
```

### Get details on a specific remote session

In this example, you get the details for remote session with the ID *SessionID*.

```powershell
Get-RemoteSupportSessionHistory -SessionId <SessionId> -IncludeSessionTranscript
```

> [!NOTE]
> Session transcript details are retained for ninety days. You can retrieve detail for a remote session within ninety days after the session.
