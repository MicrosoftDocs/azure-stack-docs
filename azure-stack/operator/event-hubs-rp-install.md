## Next steps

Before users can deploy Event Hubs resources, you must create one or more plans, offers, and subscriptions. 

- If this is the first time you're offering a service, start with the [Offer services to users](tutorial-offer-services.md) tutorial. Then continue with the next tutorial, [Test a service offering](tutorial-test-offer.md).
- Once you're familiar with the concept of offering a service, create an offer and plan that includes the Event Hubs resource provider. Then create a subscription for your users, or give them the offer information so they can create their own. For reference, you can also follow the series of articles under the [Service, plan, offer, subscription overview](service-plan-offer-subscription-overview.md).
