# App Service on Azure Stack Hub 2021 Q3 release notes

These release notes describe the improvements and fixes in Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub 2021 Q3 and any known issues. Known issues are divided into issues directly related to the deployment, update process, and issues with the build (post-installation).

[!INCLUDE [Azure Stack Hub update reminder](../includes/app-service-hub-update-banner.md)]

## Build reference

The App Service on Azure Stack Hub 2021 Q3 build number is **95.1.1.539**

## Prerequisites

Refer to the [Before You Get Started documentation](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md) before beginning deployment.

Before you begin the upgrade of Azure App Service on Azure Stack to 2021 Q3:

## Pre-Update steps

Review the [known issues for update](#known-issues-update) and take any action prescribed.

## Post-deployment steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have provided the App Service resource provider with a SQL Always On Instance you MUST [add the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to an availability group](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database) and synchronize the databases to prevent any loss of service in the event of a database failover.

## Known issues (update)

- In situations where a customer has converted the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to contained database, upgrade may fail if logins have not been successfully migrated to contained users

Customers that have converted the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to contained database post deployment, and have not successfully migrated the database logins to contained users, may experience upgrade failures.  

Customers must execute the following script against the SQL Server hosting appservice_hosting and appservice_metering before upgrading your Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub installation to 2020 Q3.  **This script is non-destructive and will not cause downtime**.

This script must be run under the following conditions

- By a user that has the system administrator privilege, for example the SQL SA Account;
- If using SQL Always on, ensure the script is run from the SQL instance that contains all App Service logins in the form:

    - appservice_hosting_FileServer
    - appservice_hosting_HostingAdmin
    - appservice_hosting_LoadBalancer
    - appservice_hosting_Operations
    - appservice_hosting_Publisher
    - appservice_hosting_SecurePublisher
    - appservice_hosting_WebWorkerManager
    - appservice_metering_Common
    - appservice_metering_Operations
    - All WebWorker logins - which are in the form WebWorker_\<instance ip address\>

            END  
            CLOSE user_cursor ;

                    @username = @username,  
                    @rename = N'copy_login_name',  
                    @disablelogin = N'do_not_disable_login';  
                FETCH NEXT FROM user_cursor INTO @username  
            END  
            CLOSE user_cursor ;  
            DEALLOCATE user_cursor ;
            END
        GO
```

## Known issues (post-installation)

- Workers are unable to reach file server when App Service is deployed in an existing virtual network and the file server is only available on the private network,  as called out in the Azure App Service on Azure Stack deployment documentation.

  If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
  - Source: Any
  - Source port range: *
  - Destination: IP Addresses
  - Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
  - Destination port range: 445
  - Protocol: TCP
  - Action: Allow
  - Priority: 700
  - Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

- To remove latency when workers are communicating with the file server we also advise adding the following rule to the Worker NSG to allow outbound LDAP and Kerberos traffic to your Active Directory Controllers if securing the file server using Active Directory, for example if you have used the Quickstart template to deploy a HA File Server and SQL Server.

  Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
  - Source: Any
  - Source port range: *
  - Destination: IP Addresses
  - Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your AD Servers, for example with the Quickstart template 10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101
  - Destination port range: 389,88
  - Protocol: Any
  - Action: Allow
  - Priority: 710
  - Name: Outbound_Allow_LDAP_and_Kerberos_to_Domain_Controllers


### Known issues for Cloud Admins operating Azure App Service on Azure Stack

- Custom domains are not supported in disconnected environments

App Service performs domain ownership verification against public DNS endpoints, as a result custom domains are not supported in disconnected scenarios.
