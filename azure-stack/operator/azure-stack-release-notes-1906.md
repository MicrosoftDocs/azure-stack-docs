# Azure Stack 1906 update

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

This article describes the contents of the 1906 update package. The update includes what's new improvements, and fixes for this release of Azure Stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This update package is only for Azure Stack integrated systems. Do not apply this update package to the Azure Stack Development Kit.

## Build reference

The Azure Stack 1906 update build number is **1.1906.0.30**.

### Update type

The Azure Stack 1906 update build type is **Express**. For more information about update build types, see the [Manage updates in Azure Stack](azure-stack-updates.md) article.

## What's in this update

<!-- The current theme (if any) of this release. -->

<!-- What's new, also net new experiences and features. -->

- Added a **Set-TLSPolicy** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to force TLS 1.2 on all the endpoints. For more information, see [Azure Stack security controls](azure-stack-security-configuration.md).

- Added a **Get-TLSPolicy** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint (PEP) to retrieve the applied TLS policy. For more information, see [Azure Stack security controls](azure-stack-security-configuration.md).

- Added an internal secret rotation procedure to rotate internal TLS certificates as required during a system update.

- Added a safeguard to prevent expiration of internal secrets by forcing internal secrets rotation in case a critical alert on expiring secrets is ignored. This should not be relied on as a regular operating procedure. Secrets rotation should be planned during a maintenance window. For more information, see [Azure Stack secret rotation](azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md).

- Visual Studio Code is now supported with Azure Stack deployment using AD FS.

### Improvements

<!-- Changes and product improvements with tangible customer-facing value. -->

- The **Get-GraphApplication** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint now displays the thumbprint of the currently used certificate. This improves the certificate management for service principals when Azure Stack is deployed with AD FS.

- New health monitoring rules have been added to validate the availability of AD Graph and AD FS, including the ability to raise alerts.

- Improvements to the reliability of the backup resource provider when the infrastructure backup service moves to another instance.

- Performance optimization of external secret rotation procedure to provide a uniform execution time to facilitate scheduling of maintenance window.

- The **Test-AzureStack** cmdlet now reports on internal secrets that are about to expire (critical alerts).

- A new parameter is available for the **Register-CustomAdfs** cmdlet in the privileged endpoint that enables skipping the certificate revocation list checking when configuring the federation trust for AD FS.

#### Networking updates

- Updated lease time set in DHCP responder to be consistent with Azure.

- Improved retry rates to the resource provider in the scenario of failed deployment of resources.

- Removed the **Standard** SKU option from both the load balancer and public IP, as that is currently not supported.

### Changes

- Creating a storage account experience is now consistent with Azure.

- Changed alert triggers for expiration of internal secrets:
  - Warning alerts are now raised 90 days prior to the expiration of secrets.
  - Critical alerts are now raised 30 days prior to the expiration of secrets.

- Updated strings in infrastructure backup resource provider for consistent terminology.

### Fixes

<!-- Product fixes that came up from customer deployments worth highlighting, especially if there is an SR/ICM associated to it. -->

- Fixed an issue where resizing a managed disk VM failed with an **Internal Operation Error**.

- Fixed an issue where a failed user image creation puts the service that manages images is in a bad state; this blocks deletion of the failed image and creation of new images. This is also fixed in the 1905 hotfix.

- Active alerts on expiring internal secrets are now automatically closed after successful execution of internal secret rotation.

- Fixed an issue in which the update duration in the update history tab would trim the first digit if the update was running for more than 99 hours.

- Fixed an issue in the **Update** blade: now includes a **Resume** option for failed updates.

- In the administrator and user portals, fixed the issue in marketplace in which the Docker extension was incorrectly returned from search but no further action could be taken, as it is not available in Azure Stack.

- Fixed an issue in template deployment UI that does not populate parameters if the template name begins with '_' underscore.
