# Integrate AD FS identity with your Azure Stack Hub datacenter

You can deploy Azure Stack Hub using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as the identity provider. The choice must be made before you deploy Azure Stack Hub. In a connected scenario, you can choose Azure AD or AD FS. For a disconnected scenario, only AD FS is supported. This article shows how to integrate Azure Stack Hub AD FS with your datacenter AD FS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't switch the identity provider without redeploying the entire Azure Stack Hub solution.

## Active Directory Federation Services and Graph

Deploying with AD FS allows identities in an existing Active Directory forest to authenticate with resources in Azure Stack Hub. This existing Active Directory forest requires a deployment of AD FS to allow the creation of an AD FS federation trust.

Authentication is one part of identity. To manage role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Stack Hub, the Graph component must be configured. When access to a resource is delegated, the Graph component looks up the user account in the existing Active Directory forest using the LDAP protocol.

![Azure Stack Hub AD FS architecture](media/azure-stack-integrate-identity/azure-stack-adfs-architecture.svg)

The existing AD FS is the account security token service (STS) that sends claims to the Azure Stack Hub AD FS (the resource STS). In Azure Stack Hub, automation creates the claims provider trust with the metadata endpoint for the existing AD FS.

At the existing AD FS, a relying party trust must be configured. This step isn't done by the automation, and must be configured by the operator. The Azure Stack Hub VIP endpoint for AD FS can be created by using the pattern `https://adfs.<Region>.<ExternalFQDN>/`.

The relying party trust configuration also requires you to configure the claim transformation rules that are provided by Microsoft.

For the Graph configuration, a service account must be provided that has "read" permission in the existing Active Directory. This account is required as input for the automation to enable RBAC scenarios.

For the last step, a new owner is configured for the default provider subscription. This account has full access to all resources when signed in to the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal.

Requirements:

|Component|Requirement|
|---------|---------|
|Graph|Microsoft Active Directory 2012/2012 R2/2016 2019|
|AD FS|Windows Server 2012/2012 R2/2016 2019|

## Setting up Graph integration

Graph only supports integration with a single Active Directory forest. If multiple forests exist, only the forest specified in the configuration will be used to fetch users and groups.

The following information is required as inputs for the automation parameters:

|Parameter|Deployment Worksheet Parameter|Description|Example|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|`CustomADGlobalCatalog`|AD FS Forest FQDN|FQDN of the target Active Directory forest that you want to integrate with|Contoso.com|
|`CustomADAdminCredentials`| |A user with LDAP Read permission|graphservice|

### Configure Active Directory Sites

For Active Directory deployments having multiple sites, configure the closest Active Directory Site to your Azure Stack Hub deployment. The configuration avoids having the Azure Stack Hub Graph service resolve queries using a Global Catalog Server from a remote site.

Add the Azure Stack Hub [Public VIP network](azure-stack-network.md#public-vip-network) subnet to the Active Directory Site closest to Azure Stack Hub. For example, let's say your Active Directory has two sites: Seattle and Redmond. If Azure Stack Hub is deployed at the Seattle site, you would add the Azure Stack Hub Public VIP network subnet to the Active Directory site for Seattle.

For more information on Active Directory Sites, see [Designing the site topology](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/designing-the-site-topology).

> [!NOTE]  
> If your Active Directory consist of a single site, you can skip this step. If you have a catch-all subnet configured, validate that the Azure Stack Hub Public VIP network subnet isn't part of it.

### Create user account in the existing Active Directory (optional)

Optionally, you can create an account for the Graph service in the existing Active Directory. Do this step if you don't already have an account that you want to use.

1. In the existing Active Directory, create the following user account (recommendation):
   - **Username**: graphservice
   - **Password**: Use a strong password and configure the password to never expire.

   No special permissions or membership is required.

#### Trigger automation to configure graph

For this procedure, use a computer in your datacenter network that can communicate with the privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Hub.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session (run as administrator), and connect to the IP address of the privileged endpoint. Use the credentials for **CloudAdmin** to authenticate.

   ```powershell  
   $creds = Get-Credential
   $pep = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP Address of ERCS> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $creds -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)
   ```

2. Now that you have a session with the privileged endpoint, run the following command: 

   **Run the below script for Azure Stack Hub build 2008 and newer** <br>

   ```powershell  
    $i = @(
           [pscustomobject]@{ 
                     CustomADGlobalCatalog="fabrikam.com"
                     CustomADAdminCredential= Get-Credential -Message "Do not include the domain name of the graphservice account in the username."
                     SkipRootDomainValidation = $false 
                     ValidateParameters = $true
                   }) 

    Invoke-Command -Session $pep -ScriptBlock {Register-DirectoryService -customCatalog $using:i} 


   ```

   **Run the below script for Azure Stack Hub build prior to 2008** <br>

   ```powershell  
   Invoke-Command -Session $pep -ScriptBlock {Register-DirectoryService -CustomADGlobalCatalog contoso.com} 
   
   
    ```

   When prompted, specify the credential for the user account that you want to use for the Graph service (such as graphservice). The input for the Register-DirectoryService cmdlet must be the forest name / root domain in the forest rather than any other domain in the forest.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Wait for the credentials pop-up (Get-Credential isn't supported in the privileged endpoint) and enter the Graph Service Account credentials.

3. The **Register-DirectoryService** cmdlet has optional parameters that you can use in certain scenarios where the existing Active Directory validation fails. When this cmdlet is executed, it validates that the provided domain is the root domain, a global catalog server can be reached, and that the provided account is granted read access.

   |Parameter|Description|
   |---------|---------|
   |`SkipRootDomainValidation`|Specifies that a child domain must be used instead of the recommended root domain.|
   |`ValidateParameters`|Bypasses all validation checks.|

#### Graph protocols and ports

Graph service in Azure Stack Hub uses the following protocols and ports to communicate with a writeable Global Catalog Server (GC) and Key Distribution Center (KDC) that can process login requests in the target Active Directory forest.

Graph service in Azure Stack Hub uses the following protocols and ports to communicate with the target Active Directory:

|Type|Port|Protocol|
|---------|---------|---------|
|LDAP|389|TCP & UDP|
|LDAP SSL|636|TCP|
|LDAP GC|3268|TCP|
|LDAP GC SSL|3269|TCP|

## Setting up AD FS integration by downloading federation metadata

The following information is required as input for the automation parameters:

|Parameter|Deployment Worksheet Parameter|Description|Example|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|CustomAdfsName|AD FS Provider Name|Name of the claims provider.<br>It appears that way on the AD FS landing page.|Contoso|
|CustomAD<br>FSFederationMetadataEndpointUri|AD FS Metadata URI|Federation metadata link.| https:\//ad01.contoso.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml |
|SigningCertificateRevocationCheck|NA|Optional Parameter to skip CRL checking.|None|

### Trigger automation to configure claims provider trust in Azure Stack Hub (by downloading federation metadata)

For this procedure, use a computer that can communicate with the privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Hub. It's expected that the certificate used by the account **STS AD FS** is trusted by Azure Stack Hub.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session and connect to the privileged endpoint.

   ```powershell  
   $creds = Get-Credential
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <IP Address of ERCS> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $creds
   ```

2. Now that you're connected to the privileged endpoint, run the following command using the parameters appropriate for your environment:

   ```powershell  
   Register-CustomAdfs -CustomAdfsName Contoso -CustomADFSFederationMetadataEndpointUri "https://ad01.contoso.com/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml"
   ```

3. Run the following command to update the owner of the default provider subscription using the parameters appropriate for your environment:

   ```powershell  
   Set-ServiceAdminOwner -ServiceAdminOwnerUpn "administrator@contoso.com"
   ```

## Setting up AD FS integration by providing federation metadata file

Beginning with version 1807, use this method if the either of the following conditions are true:

- The certificate chain is different for AD FS compared to all other endpoints in Azure Stack Hub.
- There's no network connectivity to the existing AD FS server from Azure Stack Hub's AD FS instance.

The following information is required as input for the automation parameters:

|Parameter|Description|Example|
|---------|---------|---------|
|CustomAdfsName|Name of the claims provider. It appears that way on the AD FS landing page.|Contoso|
|CustomADFSFederationMetadataFileContent|Metadata content.|$using:federationMetadataFileContent|

### Create federation metadata file

For the following procedure, you must use a computer that has network connectivity to the existing AD FS deployment, which becomes the account STS. The necessary certificates must also be installed.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session, and run the following command using the parameters appropriate for your environment:

   ```powershell  
    $url = "https://win-SQOOJN70SGL.contoso.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml"
    $webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    $webclient.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
    $metadataAsString = $webclient.DownloadString($url)
    Set-Content -Path c:\metadata.xml -Encoding UTF8 -Value $metadataAsString
   ```

2. Copy the metadata file to a computer that can communicate with the privileged endpoint.

### Trigger automation to configure claims provider trust in Azure Stack Hub (using federation metadata file)

For this procedure, use a computer that can communicate with the privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Hub and has access to the metadata file you created in a previous step.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session and connect to the privileged endpoint.

   ```powershell  
   $federationMetadataFileContent = get-content c:\metadata.xml
   $creds=Get-Credential
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <IP Address of ERCS> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $creds
   ```

2. Now that you're connected to the privileged endpoint, run the following command using the parameters appropriate for your environment:

    ```powershell
    Register-CustomAdfs -CustomAdfsName Contoso -CustomADFSFederationMetadataFileContent $using:federationMetadataFileContent
    ```

3. Run the following command to update the owner of the default provider subscription. Use the parameters appropriate for your environment.

   ```powershell  
   Set-ServiceAdminOwner -ServiceAdminOwnerUpn "administrator@contoso.com"
   ```

   > [!Note]  
   > When you rotate the certificate on the existing AD FS (account STS), you must set up the AD FS integration again. You must set up the integration even if the metadata endpoint is reachable or it was configured by providing the metadata file.

## Configure relying party on existing AD FS deployment (account STS)

Microsoft provides a script that configures the relying party trust, including the claim transformation rules. Using the script is optional as you can run the commands manually.

You can download the helper script from [Azure Stack Hub Tools](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/tree/vnext/DatacenterIntegration/Identity) on GitHub.

If you decide to manually run the commands, follow these steps:

1. Copy the following content into a .txt file (for example, saved as c:\ClaimIssuanceRules.txt) on your datacenter's AD FS instance or farm member:

   ```text
   @RuleTemplate = "LdapClaims"
   @RuleName = "Name claim"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"]
   => issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"), query = ";userPrincipalName;{0}", param = c.Value);

   @RuleTemplate = "LdapClaims"
   @RuleName = "UPN claim"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"]
   => issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn"), query = ";userPrincipalName;{0}", param = c.Value);

   @RuleTemplate = "LdapClaims"
   @RuleName = "ObjectID claim"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/primarysid"]
   => issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier", Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType);

   @RuleName = "Family Name and Given claim"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"]
   => issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname"), query = ";sn,givenName;{0}", param = c.Value);

   @RuleTemplate = "PassThroughClaims"
   @RuleName = "Pass through all Group SID claims"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groupsid", Issuer =~ "^(AD AUTHORITY|SELF AUTHORITY|LOCAL AUTHORITY)$"]
   => issue(claim = c);

   @RuleTemplate = "PassThroughClaims"
   @RuleName = "Pass through all windows account name claims"
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]
   => issue(claim = c);
   ```

2. Validate that Windows Forms-based authentication for extranet and intranet is enabled. You can check if its already enabled by running the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell  
   Get-AdfsAuthenticationProvider | where-object { $_.name -eq "FormsAuthentication" } | select Name, AllowedForPrimaryExtranet, AllowedForPrimaryIntranet
   ```

    > [!Note]  
    > The Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) supported user agent strings may be outdated for your AD FS deployment and may require an update to support the latest clients. You can read more about updating the WIA supported user agent strings in the article [Configuring intranet forms-based authentication for devices that don't support WIA](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-intranet-forms-based-authentication-for-devices-that-do-not-support-wia).<br><br>For steps to enable Form-based authentication policy, see [Configure Authentication Policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies).

3. To add the relying party trust, run the following Windows PowerShell command on your AD FS instance or a farm member. Make sure to update the AD FS endpoint and point to the file created in Step 1.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For customers running Azure Stack Hub versions 2002 and later, TLS 1.2 is enforced on the Azure Stack Hub ADFS endpoint. As such, [TLS 1.2 must also be enabled](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2-client) on the customer ADFS servers. Otherwise, the following error will occur when running `Add-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust` on the customer owned ADFS host/farm:
   >
   > `Add-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust : The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.`

   **For AD FS 2016/2019**

   ```powershell  
   Add-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -Name AzureStack -MetadataUrl "https://YourAzureStackADFSEndpoint/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml" -IssuanceTransformRulesFile "C:\ClaimIssuanceRules.txt" -AutoUpdateEnabled:$true -MonitoringEnabled:$true -enabled:$true -AccessControlPolicyName "Permit everyone" -TokenLifeTime 1440
   ```

   **For AD FS 2012/2012 R2**

   ```powershell  
   Add-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -Name AzureStack -MetadataUrl "https://YourAzureStackADFSEndpoint/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml" -IssuanceTransformRulesFile "C:\ClaimIssuanceRules.txt" -AutoUpdateEnabled:$true -MonitoringEnabled:$true -enabled:$true -TokenLifeTime 1440
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > You must use the AD FS MMC snap-in to configure the Issuance Authorization Rules when using Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2 AD FS.

4. When you use Internet Explorer or the Microsoft Edge browser to access Azure Stack Hub, you must ignore token bindings. Otherwise, the sign-in attempts fail. On your AD FS instance or a farm member, run the following command:

   > [!note]  
   > This step isn't applicable when using Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2 AD FS. In that case, it's safe to skip this command and continue with the integration.

   ```powershell  
   Set-AdfsProperties -IgnoreTokenBinding $true
   ```

## SPN creation

There are many scenarios that require the use of a service principal name (SPN) for authentication. The following are some examples:

- Azure CLI usage with AD FS deployment of Azure Stack Hub.
- System Center Management Pack for Azure Stack Hub when deployed with AD FS.
- Resource providers in Azure Stack Hub when deployed with AD FS.
- Various apps.
- You require a non-interactive sign-in.

> [!Important]  
> AD FS only supports interactive sign-in sessions. If you require a non-interactive sign-in for an automated scenario, you must use a SPN.

For more information on creating an SPN, see [Create service principal for AD FS](./give-app-access-to-resources.md).


## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Rollback

If an error occurs that leaves the environment in a state where you can no longer authenticate, a rollback option is available.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session and run the following commands:

   ```powershell  
   $creds = Get-Credential
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <IP Address of ERCS> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $creds
   ```

2. Then run the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell  
   Reset-DatacenterIntegrationConfiguration
   ```

   After running the rollback action, all configuration changes are rolled back. Only authentication with the built-in **CloudAdmin** user is possible.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must configure the original owner of the default provider subscription.

   ```powershell  
   Set-ServiceAdminOwner -ServiceAdminOwnerUpn "azurestackadmin@[Internal Domain]"
   ```

### Collecting additional logs

If any of the cmdlets fail, you can collect additional logs by using the `Get-Azurestacklogs` cmdlet.

1. Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session and run the following commands:

   ```powershell  
   $creds = Get-Credential
   Enter-pssession -ComputerName <IP Address of ERCS> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $creds
   ```

2. Then run the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell  
   Get-AzureStackLog -OutputPath \\myworkstation\AzureStackLogs -FilterByRole ECE
   ```
