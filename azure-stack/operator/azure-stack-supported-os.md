> [!NOTE]
> To deploy Windows 10 client operating systems on Azure Stack Hub, you must have [Windows per-user licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/windows10.aspx) or purchase through a [Qualified Multitenant Hoster (QMTH)](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider).

Marketplace images are available for pay-as-you-use or BYOL (EA/SPLA) licensing. Use of both on a single Azure Stack Hub instance isn't supported. During deployment, Azure Stack Hub injects a suitable version of the guest agent into the image.

Datacenter editions are available in Azure Stack Hub Marketplace for downloading; customers can bring their own server images including other editions. 

## Linux

Linux distributions listed as available in Azure Stack Hub Marketplace include the necessary Windows Azure Linux Agent (WALA). If you bring your own image to Azure Stack, follow the guidelines in [Add Linux images to Azure Stack](azure-stack-linux.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Custom images should be built with the latest public WALA version. For the minimum supported Azure Linux agent see [Minimum supported Azure Linux Agent](azure-stack-linux.md#minimum-supported-azure-linux-agent).
>
> [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) is supported.
