# Azure Stack Hub Operator Access Workstation

The Operator Access Workstation (OAW) is used to deploy a virtual machine (VM)
on an Azure Stack Hub's--Hardware Lifecycle Host (HLH) or any other machine that runs Microsoft Hyper-V. It does require network connectivity to the Azure
Stack Hub endpoints to be used for operator or user scenarios.

The OAW VM is an optional virtual machine that isn't required by Azure Stack
Hub to function. Its purpose is to provide the latest tools to operators or user
as they interact with Azure Stack Hub.

## OAW scenarios

The following tables list common scenarios for the OAW. Use Remote Desktop to connect to the OAW.

| **Scenario**                                                                                                                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Download files
To get the files to create the OAW VM, [download here](https://aka.ms/OAWDownload). Be sure to review the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and [Legal Terms](/legal/azure-stack-hub/azure-stack-operator-access-workstation-legal-terms) before you download.

Because of the stateless nature of the solution, there are no updates for the OAW VM. For each milestone, a new version of the VM image file is released. Use the latest version to create a new OAW VM. The image file is based on the latest Windows Server 2019 version. After installation, you can apply updates, including any critical updates, using Windows Update.

Validate the hash of the downloaded OAW.zip file to make sure it hasn't been modified before using it to create the OAW VM. Run the following PowerShell script. If the return value is True, you can use the downloaded OAW.zip:


> [!NOTE]  
> Unblock the script files after extracting the download.

```powershell
param( 
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)] 
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()] 
    [ValidateScript({Test-Path $_ -PathType Leaf})] 
    [string] 
    $DownloadedOAWZipFilePath 
) 
$expectedHash = '8E23B79B2E2DE00664A0821ABDFEF5E22213CC3B6C50442438089E5B3187552F' 
$actualHash = (Get-FileHash -Path $DownloadedOAWZipFilePath).Hash 
Write-Host "Expected hash: $expectedHash" 
if ($expectedHash -eq $actualHash) 
{ 
    Write-Host 'SUCCESS: OAW.zip file hash matches.' 
} 
else 
{ 
    Write-Error "ERROR: OAW.zip file hash does not match! It isn't safe to use it, please download it again. Actual hash: $actualHash" 
}
```

Another way to copy this script to your environment is to use the Test-FileHash cmdlet that's offered in [AzureStack-Tools](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/tree/az/HashVerify/Test-FileHash.psm1) to verify the hash of the OAW.zip file:

1. Download the [Test-FileHash.psm1](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/tree/az/HashVerify/Test-FileHash.psm1) file from GitHub, and then run:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module .\Test-FileHash.psm1 -Force -Verbose
   ```

2. After you import the Test-FileHash module, verify the hash of the OAW.zip file:
 
   ```powershell
   Test-FileHash -ExpectedHash "8E23B79B2E2DE00664A0821ABDFEF5E22213CC3B6C50442438089E5B3187552F" -FilePath "<path to the OAW.zip file>"
   ```

## Check HLH version

> [!NOTE]  
> This step is important to determine if you deploy the OAW on a HLH that was deployed using a Microsoft image or an OEM image. This PowerShell cmdlet is not present on a HLH that was deployed using an OEM image. If you deploy the OAW on a general Microsoft Hyper-V, you can skip this step. 

1.  Sign in to the HLH with your credentials.

2.  Open PowerShell ISE and run the following script:

    ```powershell  
    C:\Version\Get-Version.ps1
    ```

    For example:

    ![Screenshot of PowerShell cmdlet to check the version of the OAW VM.](media/operator-access-workstation/check-operator-access-workstation-vm-version.png)

## Create the OAW VM using a script

The following script prepares the virtual machine as the Operator Access Workstation (OAW), which is used to access Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.

1.  Sign in to the HLH with your credentials.

2.  Download OAW.zip and extract the files.

3.  Open an elevated PowerShell session.

4.  Navigate to the extracted contents of the OAW.zip file.

5.  Run the New-OAW.ps1 script.

### Example: Deploy on HLH using a Microsoft Image

```powershell  
$oawRootPath = "D:\oawtest"
$securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString

if (Get-ChildItem -Path $oawRootPath -Recurse | Get-Item -Stream Zone* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FileName)
{ Write-Host "Execution failed, unblock the script files first" }
else { New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword }
```


### Example: Deploy on HLH using an OEM Image

```powershell  
$oawRootPath = "D:\oawtest"
$securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString

if (Get-ChildItem -Path $oawRootPath -Recurse | Get-Item -Stream Zone* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FileName)
{ Write-Host "Execution failed, unblock the script files first" }
else { New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword -AzureStackCertificatePath 'F:\certroot.cer' -DeploymentDataFilePath 'F:\DeploymentData.json' -AzSStampInfoFilePath 'F:\AzureStackStampInformation.json' }
```

If the `AzureStackStampInformation.json` file includes the naming prefix for OAW VM, that value will be used for the `VirtualMachineName` parameter. Otherwise, the default name is `AzSOAW` or whatever name specified is by the user. The `AzureStackStampInformation.json` can be re-created using the [privileged endpoint](../reference/pep/get-azurestackstampinformation.md) in case it is not present on the HLH. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The parameter `AzureStackCertificatePath` should only be used when Azure Stack Hub was deployed using certificates issued from an enterprise certificate authority. If the `DeploymentData.json` is not available, reach out to your hardware partner to retrieve it or continue with the example deploy on Microsoft Hyper-V.

### Example: Deploy on Microsoft Hyper-V

The machine running Microsoft Hyper-V does requires four (4) cores and two (2) GB of available memory. The PowerShell cmdlets will create the OAW VM without applying an IP configuration to the guest network interface. If you use the example to provision the OAW on a HLH you must configure the IP Address originally used by the **Deployment VM** (DVM), which is typically the second to last IP of the BMC Network.

| Examples | IPs |
| --- | --- |
| BMC Network | 10.26.5.192/26 |
| First Host IP | 10.26.5.193 |
| Last Host IP | 10.26.5.254 |
| DVM/OAW IP | 10.26.5.253 |
| Subnet Mask | 255.255.255.192 |
| Default Gateway | 10.26.5.193 |

```powershell  
$oawRootPath = "D:\oawtest"
$securePassword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password for Azure Stack OAW's local administrator" -AsSecureString

if (Get-ChildItem -Path $oawRootPath -Recurse | Get-Item -Stream Zone* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FileName)
{ Write-Host "Execution failed, unblock the script files first" }
else { New-OAW.ps1 -LocalAdministratorPassword $securePassword -AzureStackCertificatePath 'F:\certroot.cer' `-SkipNetworkConfiguration -VirtualSwitchName Example }
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The parameter `AzureStackCertificatePath` should only be used when Azure Stack Hub was deployed using certificates issued from an enterprise certificate authority. The OAW virtual machine will be deployed without a network configuration. You can configure a static IP address or retrieve an IP address via DHCP.

## User account policy

The following user account policy is applied to the OAW VM:
 - Built-in Administrator username: AdminUser
 - MinimumPasswordLength = 14
 - PasswordComplexity is enabled
 - MinimumPasswordAge = 1 (day)
 - MaximumPasswordAge = 42 (days)
 - NewGuestName = GUser (disabled by default)

## New-OAW cmdlet parameters

Two parameter sets are available for New-OAW. Optional parameters are shown in

| TimeServer                 | Required              | IP address of the time server that Azure Stack Hub syncs from, which will be the time source that OAW syncs from too. Check the AzureStackStampInformation.json or ask your admin for the IP of the time server that Hub syncs from. In case of urgency and you could not get the IP of the time server that Hub syncs from, you could input the default time server, 'time.windows.com,0x8' for this parameter. Note that it is highly recommended to make sure the time in OAW and Hub is in sync to avoid potential clock skew issues when working in an OAW to interact with Hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Check the OAW VM version

1.  Sign into the OAW VM with your credentials.

2.  Open PowerShell ISE and run the following script:

    ```powershell  
    C:\\Version\\Get-Version.ps1
    ```

    For example:
    
    ![Screenshot of PowerShell cmdlet to check the Hardware LifeCycle Host version.](media/operator-access-workstation/check-operator-access-workstation-vm-version.png)

## Transfer files between the HLH and OAW

If you need to transfer files between the HLH and the OAW, create an SMB share
by using the [New-SmbShare](/powershell/module/smbshare/new-smbshare?view=win10-ps) cmdlet.
New-SmbShare exposes a file system folder to remote clients as a Server Message
Block (SMB) share. For example:

To delete a share that was created by this cmdlet, use
the [Remove-SmbShare](/powershell/module/smbshare/remove-smbshare?view=win10-ps) cmdlet.

## Remove the OAW VM

The following script removes the OAW VM, which is used to access Azure Stack Hub
for administration and diagnostics. This script also removes the disk files and
the guardian associated with the VM.

1. Sign into the HLH with your credentials.

2.  Open an elevated PowerShell session.

3.  Navigate to the extracted contents of the installed OAW.zip file.

4.  Remove the VM by running the Remove-OAW.ps1 script:

    ```powershell  
    Remove-OAW.ps1 -VirtualMachineName \<name\>
    ```
    Where \<name\> is the name of the virtual machine to be removed. By default, the name is **AzSOAW**.

    For example:

    ```powershell  
    Remove-OAW.ps1 -VirtualMachineName AzSOAW
    ```
