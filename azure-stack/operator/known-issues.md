## Update

For known Azure Stack Hub update issues, see [Troubleshooting Updates in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-troubleshooting.md#troubleshoot-azure-stack-hub-updates).

## Portal

### Administrative subscriptions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The two administrative subscriptions that were introduced with version 1804 should not be used. The subscription types are **Metering** subscription, and **Consumption** subscription.
- Remediation: If you have resources running on these two subscriptions, recreate them in user subscriptions.
- Occurrence: Common

## Networking

### Network Security Groups

#### Cannot delete an NSG if NICs not attached to running VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When disassociating an NSG and a NIC that is not attached to a running VM, the update (PUT) operation for that object fails at the network controller layer. The NSG will be updated at the network resource provider layer, but not on the network controller, so the NSG moves to a failed state.
- Remediation: Attach the NICs associated to the NSG that needs to be removed with running VMs, and disassociate the NSG or remove all the NICs that were associated with the NSG.
- Occurrence: Common

#### DenyAllOutbound rule cannot be created

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule to the internet cannot be created in an NSG during VM creation as this will prevent the communication required for the VM deployment to complete.
- Remediation: Allow outbound traffic to the internet during VM creation, and modify the NSG to block the required traffic after VM creation is complete.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

#### Documentation

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack Hub. Use the following links for the Azure Stack Hub documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)
  - [Highly Available Connections](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-availability)
  - [Configure BGP on Azure Stack Hub](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-settings.md#gateway-requirements)
  - [ExpressRoute circuits](azure-stack-connect-expressroute.md)
  - [Specify custom IPsec/IKE policies](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-settings.md#ipsecike-parameters)
  
### Load Balancer

#### Load Balancer directing traffic to one backend VM in specific scenarios

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: When enabling **Session Affinity** on a load balancer, the 2 tuple hash utilizes the PA IP (Physical Address IP) instead of the private IPs assigned to the VMs. In scenarios where traffic directed to the load balancer arrives through a VPN, or if all the client VMs (source IPs) reside on the same node and Session Affinity is enabled, all traffic is directed to one backend VM.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Public IP

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The **IdleTimeoutInMinutes** value for a public IP that is associated to a load balancer cannot be changed. The operation puts the public IP into a failed state.
- Remediation: To bring the public IP back into a successful state, change the **IdleTimeoutInMinutes** value on the load balancer rule that references the public IP back to the original value (the default is 4 minutes).
- Occurrence: Common

## Compute

### Issues deploying VMSS with Standard_DS2_v2 size using the portal
- Applicable: This issue applies to only the 2005 release
- Cause: Portal bug is causing VMSS creation with Standard_DS2_v2 size to fail
- Remediation: Please use powershell or cli to deploy this VMSS VM size

### Issues using VM extensions in Ubuntu Server 20.04

- Applicable: This issue applies to **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**.
- Cause: Some Linux distributions have transitioned to Python 3.8 and removed the legacy `/usr/bin/python` entrypoint for Python altogether. Linux distribution users who have transitioned to Python 3.x must ensure the legacy `/usr/bin/python` entry point exists before attempting to deploy those extensions to their VMs. Otherwise, the extension deployment might fail.
- Remediation: Follow the resolution steps in [Issues using VM extensions in Python 3-enabled Linux Azure Virtual Machines systems](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/issues-using-vm-extensions-python-3) but skip step 2, because Azure Stack Hub does not have the **Run command** functionality.

### NVv4 VM size on portal

- Applicable: This issue applies to 2002 and later.
- Cause: When going through the VM creation experience, you will see the VM size: NV4as_v4. Customers who have the hardware required for the AMD MI25-based Azure Stack Hub GPU preview are able to have a successful VM deployment. All other customers will have a failed VM deployment with this VM size.
- Remediation: By design in preparation for the Azure Stack Hub GPU preview.

### Consumed compute quota

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new virtual machine, you may receive an error such as **This subscription is at capacity for Total Regional vCPUs on this location. This subscription is using all 50 Total Regional vCPUs available.**. This indicates that the quota for total cores available to you has been reached.
- Remediation: Ask your operator for an add-on plan with additional quota. Editing the current plan's quota will not work or reflect increased quota.
- Occurrence: Rare

### VM overview blade does not show correct computer name

- Applicable: This issue applies to all releases.
- Cause: When viewing details of a VM in the overview blade, the computer name shows as **(not available)**. This is by design for VMs created from specialized disks/disk snapshots, and appears for Marketplace images as well.
- Remediation: View the **Properties** blade under **Settings**.

### Virtual machine scale set

#### Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack Hub environments

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub deployment.

## Storage

### Retention period reverts to 0

- Applicable: This issue applies to releases 2002 and 2005.
- Cause: If you specify a time period other than 0 in the retention period setting, it reverts to 0 (the default value of this setting) during the 2002 or 2005 update. The 0 days setting takes effect immediately after the update finishes, which causes all existing deleted storage accounts and any upcoming newly deleted storage accounts to be immediately out of retention and marked for periodic garbage collection (which runs hourly).
- Remediation: Manually specify the retention period to a correct period. Any storage account that has already been garbage collected before the new retention period is specified, is not recoverable.  

## Resource providers

### SQL/MySQL

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002.
- Cause: If the stamp contains SQL resource provider (RP) version 1.1.33.0 or earlier, upon update of the stamp, the blades for SQL/MySQL do not load.
- Remediation: Update the RP to version 1.1.47.0.

### App Service

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002.
- Cause: If the stamp contains App Service resource provider (RP) version 1.7 and older, upon update of the stamp, the blades for App Service do not load.
- Remediation: Update the RP to version 2002 Q2.

For known Azure Stack Hub update issues, see [Troubleshooting Updates in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-troubleshooting.md#troubleshoot-azure-stack-hub-updates).

## Portal

### Administrative subscriptions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The two administrative subscriptions that were introduced with version 1804 should not be used. The subscription types are **Metering** subscription, and **Consumption** subscription.
- Remediation: If you have resources running on these two subscriptions, recreate them in user subscriptions.
- Occurrence: Common

### Subscription permissions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: You cannot view permissions to your subscription using the Azure Stack Hub portals.
- Remediation: Use [PowerShell to verify permissions](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermroleassignment).
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account options

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the name of storage accounts is shown as **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**; however, **file** is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Create Managed Disk snapshot

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002.
- Cause: In the user portal, when creating a Managed Disk snapshot, the **Account type** box is empty. When you select the **Create** button with an empty account type, the snapshot creation fails.
- Remediation: Select an account type from the **Account type** dropdown list, then create the snapshot.
- Occurrence: Common

### Alert for network interface disconnected

- Applicable: This issue applies to 1908 and later.
- Cause: When a cable is disconnected from a network adapter, an alert does not show in the administrator portal. This issue is caused because this fault is disabled by default in Windows Server 2019.
- Occurrence: Common

## Networking

### DenyAllOutbound rule cannot be created

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule to the internet cannot be created in an NSG during VM creation as this will prevent the communication required for the VM deployment to complete.
- Remediation: Allow outbound traffic to the internet during VM creation, and modify the NSG to block the required traffic after VM creation is complete.
- Occurrence: Common

### ICMP protocol not supported for NSG rules

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: When creating an inbound or an outbound network security rule, the **Protocol** option shows an **ICMP** option. This is currently not supported on Azure Stack Hub. This issue is fixed and will not appear in the next Azure Stack Hub release.
- Occurrence: Common

### Cannot delete an NSG if NICs not attached to running VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When disassociating an NSG and a NIC that is not attached to a running VM, the update (PUT) operation for that object fails at the network controller layer. The NSG will be updated at the network resource provider layer, but not on the network controller, so the NSG moves to a failed state.
- Remediation: Attach the NICs associated to the NSG that needs to be removed with running VMs, and disassociate the NSG or remove all the NICs that were associated with the NSG.
- Occurrence: Common

### Load Balancer directing traffic to one backend VM in specific scenarios 

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: When enabling **Session Affinity** on a load balancer, the 2 tuple hash utilizes the PA IP (Physical Address IP) instead of the private IPs assigned to the VMs. In scenarios where traffic directed to the load balancer arrives through a VPN, or if all the client VMs (source IPs) reside on the same node and Session Affinity is enabled, all traffic is directed to one backend VM.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network interface

#### Adding/removing network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new network interface cannot be added to a VM that is in a **running** state.
- Remediation: Stop the virtual machine before adding or removing a network interface.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Primary network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The primary NIC of a VM cannot be changed. Deleting or detaching the primary NIC results in issues when starting up the VM.
- Occurrence: Common

### Public IP

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The **IdleTimeoutInMinutes** value for a public IP that is associated to a load balancer cannot be changed. The operation puts the public IP into a failed state.
- Remediation: To bring the public IP back into a successful state, change the **IdleTimeoutInMinutes** value on the load balancer rule that references the public IP back to the original value (the default value is 4 minutes).
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

#### Documentation

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack Hub. Use the following links for the Azure Stack Hub documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)
  - [Highly Available Connections](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-availability)

## Compute

### Cannot create a VMSS with Standard_DS2_v2 VM size on portal

- Applicable: This issue applies to the 2002 release.
- Cause: There is a portal bug that prevents VMSS creation with the Standard_DS2_v2 VM size. Creating one will error out with: "{"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"BadRequest","message":"{\r\n \"error\": {\r\n \"code\": \"NetworkProfileValidationError\",\r\n \"message\": \"Virtual Machine size Standard_DS2_v2 is not in the allowed list of VM sizes for accelerated networking to be enabled on the VM at index 0 for VM Scale Set /subscriptions/x/resourceGroups/RGVMSS/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/vmss. Allowed sizes: .\"\r\n }\r\n}"}]}"
- Remediation: Create a VMSS with PowerShell or a resource manager template.

### VM overview blade does not show correct computer name

- Applicable: This issue applies to all releases.
- Cause: When viewing details of a VM in the overview blade, the computer name shows as **(not available)**. This is by design for VMs created from specialized disks/disk snapshots, and appears for Marketplace images as well.
- Remediation: View the **Properties** blade under **Settings**.

### NVv4 VM size on portal

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002 and later.
- Cause: When going through the VM creation experience, you will see the VM size: NV4as_v4. Customers who have the hardware required for the AMD MI25-based Azure Stack Hub GPU preview are able to have a successful VM deployment. All other customers will have a failed VM deployment with this VM size.
- Remediation: By design in preparation for the Azure Stack Hub GPU preview.

### VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new virtual machine (VM), the following error might be displayed: **Failed to start virtual machine 'vm-name'. Error: Failed to update serial output settings for VM 'vm-name'**. The error occurs if you enable boot diagnostics on a VM, but delete your boot diagnostics storage account.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When trying to start a stop-deallocated virtual machine,the following error might be displayed: **VM diagnostics Storage account 'diagnosticstorageaccount' not found. Ensure storage account is not deleted**. The error occurs if you attempt to start a VM with boot diagnostics enabled, but the referenced boot diagnostics storage account is deleted.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### Consumed compute quota

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new virtual machine, you may receive an error such as **This subscription is at capacity for Total Regional vCPUs on this location. This subscription is using all 50 Total Regional vCPUs available.**. This indicates that the quota for total cores available to you has been reached.
- Remediation: Ask your operator for an add-on plan with additional quota. Editing the current plan's quota will not work or reflect increased quota.
- Occurrence: Rare

### Virtual machine scale set

#### Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack Hub environments

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub deployment.

### SQL VM

#### Storage account creating failure when configuring Auto Backup

- Applicable: This issue applies to 2002.
- Cause: When configuring the automated backup of SQL VMs with a new storage account, it fails with the error **Deployment template validation failed. The template parameter for 'SqlAutobackupStorageAccountKind' is not found.**
- Remediation: Apply the latest 2002 hotfix.

#### Auto backup cannot be configured with TLS 1.2 enabled

- Applicable: This issue applies to new installations of 2002 and later, or any previous release with TLS 1.2 enabled.
- Cause: When configuring the automated backup of SQL VMs with an existing storage account, it fails with the error **SQL Server IaaS Agent: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.**
- Occurrence: Common

## Storage

### Retention period revert to 0

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002 and 2005.
- Cause: If you previously specified a time period other than 0 in retention period setting, it would be reverted back to 0 (the default value of this setting) during 2002 and 2005 update. And the 0 days setting would take effect immdiately after update finished, which causes all the existing deleted storage accounts and any upcoming newly deleted storage account being immediately out of retention and marked for periodic garbage collection (which runs hourly). 
- Remediation: Manually specify the retention period to a proper period. However, any storage account already been garbage collected before the new retention period is specified is not recoverable.  

## Resource providers

### SQL/MySQL

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002. 
- Cause: If the stamp contains SQL resource provider (RP) version 1.1.33.0 or earlier, upon update of the stamp, the blades for SQL/MySQL will not load.
- Remediation: Update the RP to version 1.1.47.0

### App Service

- Applicable: This issue applies to release 2002.
- Cause: If the stamp contains App Service resource provider (RP) version 1.7 and older, upon update of the stamp, the blades for App Service do not load.
- Remediation: Update the RP to version [2020 Q2](azure-stack-app-service-update.md).

For known Azure Stack Hub update issues, see [Troubleshooting Updates in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-troubleshooting.md#troubleshoot-azure-stack-hub-updates).

## Portal

### Administrative subscriptions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The two administrative subscriptions that were introduced with version 1804 should not be used. The subscription types are **Metering** subscription, and **Consumption** subscription.
- Remediation: If you have resources running on these two subscriptions, recreate them in user subscriptions.
- Occurrence: Common

### Duplicate Subscription button in Lock blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the administrator portal, the **Lock** blade for user subscriptions has two buttons that say **Subscription**.
- Occurrence: Common

### Subscription permissions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: You cannot view permissions to your subscription using the Azure Stack Hub portals.
- Remediation: Use [PowerShell to verify permissions](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermroleassignment).
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account settings

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the storage account **Configuration** blade shows an option to change **security transfer type**. The feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Upload blob with OAuth error

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you try to upload a blob using the **OAuth(preview)** option, the task fails with an error message.
- Remediation: Upload the blob using the SAS option.
- Occurrence: Common

### Upload blob option unsupported

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you try to upload a blob in the upload blade, there is an option to select **AAD** or **Key Authentication**, however **AAD** is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Alert for network interface disconnected

- Applicable: This issue applies to 1908 and above.
- Cause: When a cable is disconnected from a network adapter, an alert does not show in the administrator portal. This issue is caused because this fault is disabled by default in Windows Server 2019.
- Occurrence: Common

### Incorrect tooltip when creating VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you select a managed disk, with disk type Premium SSD, the drop-down list shows **OS Disk**. The tooltip next to that option says **Certain OS Disk sizes may be available for free with Azure Free Account**; however, this is not valid for Azure Stack Hub. In addition, the list includes **Free account eligible** which is also not valid for Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Delete a storage container

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when a user attempts to delete a storage container, the operation fails when the user does not toggle **Override Azure Policy and RBAC Role settings**.
- Remediation: Ensure that the box is checked for **Override Azure Policy and RBAC Role settings**.
- Occurrence: Common

### Refresh button on virtual machines fails

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you navigate to **Virtual Machines** and try to refresh using the button at the top, the states fail to update accurately.
- Remediation: The status is automatically updated every 5 minutes regardless of whether the refresh button has been clicked or not. Wait 5 minutes and check the status.
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account options

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the name of storage accounts is shown as **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**; however, **file** is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account configuration

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you create a storage account and view its **Configuration**, you cannot save configuration changes, as it results in an AJAX error.
- Occurrence: Common

### Capacity monitoring in SQL resource provider keeps loading

- Applicable: This issue applies to the Azure Stack Hub 1910 update or later, with SQL resource provider version 1.1.33.0 or earlier installed.
- Cause: The current version of the SQL resource provider is not compatible with some of the latest portal changes in the 1910 update.
- Remediation: Follow the resource provider update process to apply the SQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack Hub is upgraded to the 1910 update ([SQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestacksqlrp11470)). For the MySQL resource provider, it is also recommended that you apply the MySQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack Hub is upgraded to 1910 update ([MySQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestackmysqlrp11470)).
- Occurrence: Common

### Access Control (IAM)

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The IAM extension is out of date. The Ibiza portal that shipped with Azure Stack Hub introduces a new behavior that causes the RBAC extension to fail if the user is opening the **Access Control (IAM)** blade for a subscription that is not selected in the global subscription selector (**Directory + Subscription** in the user portal). The blade displays **Loading** in a loop, and the user cannot add new roles to the subscription. The **Add** blade also displays **Loading** in a loop.
- Remediation: Ensure that the subscription is checked in the **Directory + Subscription** menu. The menu can be accessed from the top of the portal, near the **Notifications** button, or via the shortcut on the **All resources** blade that displays **Don't see a subscription? Open Directory + Subscription settings**. The subscription must be selected in this menu.

### SQL resource provider

- Applicable: This issue applies to stamps that are running 1908 or earlier.
- Cause: When deploying the SQL resource provider (RP) version 1.1.47.0, the portal shows no assets other than those associated with the SQL RP.
- Remediation: Delete the RP, upgrade the stamp, and re-deploy the SQL RP.

### Activity log blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to stamps that are running 1907 or later. <!-- Note: Applies to 2002 as well -->
- Cause: When accessing the activity log, the portal only shows the first page of entries. **Load more results** will not load addition entries.
- Remediation: Adjust the time range in the filter to review entries that fall after the first page.

## Networking

### Load balancer

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When adding availability set VMs to the backend pool of a load balancer, an error message is displayed on the portal stating **Failed to save load balancer backend pool**. This is a cosmetic issue on the portal; the functionality is still in place and VMs are successfully added to the backend pool internally.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network Security Groups

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule cannot be created in an NSG as this will prevent all internal communication to infrastructure needed for the VM deployment to complete.
- Occurrence: Common

### Service endpoints

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network** blade shows an option to use **Service Endpoints**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Cannot delete an NSG if NICs not attached to running VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When disassociating an NSG and a NIC that is not attached to a running VM, the update (PUT) operation for that object fails at the network controller layer. The NSG will be updated at the network resource provider layer, but not on the network controller, so the NSG moves to a failed state.
- Remediation: Attach the NICs associated to the NSG that needs to be removed with running VMs, and disassociate the NSG or remove all the NICs that were associated with the NSG.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network interface

#### Adding/removing network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new network interface cannot be added to a VM that is in a **running** state.
- Remediation: Stop the virtual machine before adding or removing a network interface.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Primary network interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The primary NIC of a VM cannot be changed. Deleting or detaching the primary NIC results in issues when starting up the VM.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

#### Next Hop Type

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you create a route table, **Virtual Network gateway** appears as one of the next hop type options; however, this is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Alerts

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network Gateway** blade shows an option to use **Alerts**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Active-Active

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, while creating, and in the resource menu of **Virtual Network Gateway**, you will see an option to enable **Active-Active** configuration. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### VPN troubleshooter

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Connections** blade displays a feature called **VPN Troubleshooter**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### VPN troubleshooter

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **VPN Troubleshoot** feature and **Metrics** in a VPN gateway resource appears, however this is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Documentation

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack Hub. Use the following links for the Azure Stack Hub documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)

## Compute

### VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new Windows virtual machine (VM), the following error might be displayed: **Failed to start virtual machine 'vm-name'. Error: Failed to update serial output settings for VM 'vm-name'**. The error occurs if you enable boot diagnostics on a VM, but delete your boot diagnostics storage account.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### Consumed compute quota

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new virtual machine, you may receive an error such as **This subscription is at capacity for Total Regional vCPUs on this location. This subscription is using all 50 Total Regional vCPUs available.**. This indicates that the quota for total cores available to you has been reached.
- Remediation: Ask your operator for an add-on plan with additional quota. Editing the current plan's quota will not work or reflect increased quota.
- Occurrence: Rare

### Privileged Endpoint

- Applicable: This issue applies to 1910 and earlier releases.
- Cause: Unable to connect to the Privileged Endpoint (ERC VMs) from a computer running a non-English version of Windows.
- Remediation: This is a known issue that has been fixed in releases later than 1910. As a workaround you can run the **New-PSSession** and **Enter-PSSession** PowerShell cmdlets using the **en-US** culture; for examples, set the culture using this script: https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596528492/blob/master/Use-Culture.ps1.
- Occurrence: Rare

### Virtual machine scale set

#### Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack Hub environments

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub deployment.

## 1908 update process

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When attempting to install the Azure Stack Hub update, the status for the update might fail and change state to **PreparationFailed**. This is caused by the update resource provider (URP) being unable to properly transfer the files from the storage container to an internal infrastructure share for processing.
- Remediation: Starting with version 1901 (1.1901.0.95), you can work around this issue by clicking **Update now** again (not **Resume**). The URP then cleans up the files from the previous attempt, and restarts the download. If the problem persists, we recommend manually uploading the update package by following the [Install updates section](azure-stack-apply-updates.md#install-updates-and-monitor-progress).
- Occurrence: Common

## Portal

### Administrative subscriptions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The two administrative subscriptions that were introduced with version 1804 should not be used. The subscription types are **Metering** subscription, and **Consumption** subscription.
- Remediation: If you have resources running on these two subscriptions, recreate them in user subscriptions.
- Occurrence: Common

### Subscriptions Properties blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the administrator portal, the **Properties** blade for subscriptions does not load correctly
- Remediation: You can view these subscription properties in the **Essentials** pane of the **Subscriptions Overview** blade.
- Occurrence: Common

### Duplicate Subscription button in Lock blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the administrator portal, the **Lock** blade for user subscriptions has two buttons labeled **subscription**.
- Occurrence: Common

### Subscription permissions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: You cannot view permissions to your subscription using the Azure Stack Hub portals.
- Remediation: Use [PowerShell to verify permissions](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermroleassignment).
- Occurrence: Common

### Storage account settings

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the storage account **Configuration** blade shows an option to change **security transfer type**. The feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Upload blob

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you try to upload a blob using the **OAuth(preview)** option, the task fails with an error message.
- Remediation: Upload the blob using the SAS option.
- Occurrence: Common

### Alert for network interface disconnected

- Applicable: This issue applies to the 1908 release.
- Cause: When a cable is disconnected from a network adapter, an alert does not show in the administrator portal. This issue is caused because this fault is disabled by default in Windows Server 2019.
- Occurrence: Common

## Networking

### Load Balancer

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: When adding Availability Set VMs to the backend pool of a Load Balancer, an error message is being displayed on the portal stating **Failed to save load balancer backend pool**. This is a cosmetic issue on the portal, the functionality is still in place and VMs are successfully added to the backend pool interally. 
- Occurrence: Common

### Network Security Groups

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule cannot be created in an NSG as this will prevent all internal communication to infrastructure needed for the VM deployment to complete.
- Occurrence: Common

### Service endpoints

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network** blade shows an option to use **Service Endpoints**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

### Cannot delete an NSG if NICs not attached to running VM

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When disassociating an NSG and a NIC that is not attached to a running VM, the update (PUT) operation for that object fails at the network controller layer. The NSG will be updated at the network resource provider layer, but not on the network controller, so the NSG moves to a failed state.
- Remdiation: Attach the NICs associated to the NSG that needs to be removed with running VMs, and disassociate the NSG or remove all the NICs that were associated with the NSG.
- Occurrence: Common

### Network interface

#### Adding/Removing Network Interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new network interface cannot be added to a VM that is in a **running** state.
- Remediation: Stop the virtual machine before adding/removing a network interface.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Primary Network Interface

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new network interface cannot be added to a VM that is in a **running** state.
- Remediation: Stop the virtual machine before adding/removing a network interface.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual Network Gateway

#### Next Hop Type

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, when you create a route table, **Virtual Network gateway** appears as one of the next hop type options; however, this is not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Alerts

- Cause: In the user portal, the **Virtual Network Gateway** blade shows an option to use **Alerts**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Active-Active

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, while creating, and in the resource menu of **Virtual Network Gateway**, you will see an option to enable **Active-Active** configuration. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### VPN troubleshooter

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Connections** blade shows a feature called **VPN Troubleshooter**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Occurrence: Common

#### Documentation

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack Hub. Use the following links for the Azure Stack Hub documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)
  - [Highly Available Connections](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-availability)

## Compute

### VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new Windows virtual machine (VM), the following error may be displayed:
**Failed to start virtual machine 'vm-name'. Error: Failed to update serial output settings for VM 'vm-name'**. The error occurs if you enable boot diagnostics on a VM, but delete your boot diagnostics storage account.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual machine scale set

#### Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack Hub environments

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack Hub.

### Ubuntu SSH access

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: An Ubuntu 18.04 VM created with SSH authorization enabled does not allow you to use the SSH keys to sign in.
- Remediation: Use VM access for the Linux extension to implement SSH keys after provisioning, or use password-based authentication.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual machine scale set reset password does not work

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: A new reset password blade appears in the scale set UI, but Azure Stack Hub does not support resetting password on a scale set yet.
- Remediation: None.
- Occurrence: Common

### Rainy cloud on scale set diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The virtual machine scale set overview page shows an empty chart. Clicking on the empty chart opens a "rainy cloud" blade. This is the chart for scale set diagnostic information, such as CPU percentage, and is not a feature supported in the current Azure Stack Hub build.
- Remediation: None.
- Occurrence: Common

### Virtual machine diagnostic settings blade

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.    
- Cause: The virtual machine diagnostic settings blade has a **Sink** tab, which asks for an **Application Insight Account**. This is the result of a new blade and is not yet supported in Azure Stack Hub.
- Remediation: None.
- Occurrence: Common
