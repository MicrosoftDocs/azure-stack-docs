::: moniker range="azs-1908"
## 1908 update process

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When attempting to install the Azure Stack update, the status for the update might fail and change state to **PreparationFailed**. This is caused by the update resource provider (URP) being unable to properly transfer the files from the storage container to an internal infrastructure share for processing.
- Remediation: Starting with version 1901 (1.1901.0.95), you can work around this issue by clicking **Update now** again (not **Resume**). The URP then cleans up the files from the previous attempt, and restarts the download. If the problem persists, we recommend manually uploading the update package by following the [Install updates section](azure-stack-apply-updates.md#install-updates-and-monitor-progress).
- Occurrence: Common

## Portal

### Administrative subscriptions

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The two administrative subscriptions that were introduced with version 1804 should not be used. The subscription types are **Metering** subscription, and **Consumption** subscription.
