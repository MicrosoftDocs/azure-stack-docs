# Rotate secrets in Azure Stack Hub

This article provides guidance for performing secret rotation, to help maintain secure communication with Azure Stack Hub infrastructure resources and services.

## Overview

Azure Stack Hub uses secrets to maintain secure communication with infrastructure resources and services. To maintain the integrity of the Azure Stack Hub infrastructure, operators need the ability to rotate secrets at frequencies that are consistent with their organization's security requirements.

When secrets are nearing expiration, the following alerts are generated in the administrator portal. Completing secret rotation will resolve these alerts:

- Pending service account password expiration
- Pending internal certificate expiration
- Pending external certificate expiration

> [!WARNING]
> There are 2 phases of alerts triggered in the administrator portal prior to expiration:
> - 90 days before expiration a warning alert is generated.
> - 30 days before expiration a critical alert is generated. 
>
> **It's *critical* that you complete secret rotation if you receive these notifications. Failure to do so can cause the loss of workloads and possible Azure Stack Hub redeployment at your own expense!**

For more information on alert monitoring and remediation, see [Monitor health and alerts in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-monitor-health.md).

::: moniker range="<azs-1811"  
> [!NOTE]
> Azure Stack Hub environments on pre-1811 versions may see alerts for pending internal certificate or secret expirations. These alerts are inaccurate and should be ignored without running internal secret rotation. Inaccurate internal secret expiration alerts are a known issue that's resolved in 1811. Internal secrets won't expire unless the environment has been active for two years.
::: moniker-end

## Prerequisites

1. It's highly recommended that you're running a supported version of Azure Stack Hub and that you apply the latest available hotfix for the Azure Stack Hub version your instance is running. For example, if you're running 2008, make sure you've installed the latest hotfix available for 2008.

    ::: moniker range="<azs-1811"  
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > For pre-1811 versions:
    > - If secret rotation has already been performed, you must update to version 1811 or later before you perform secret rotation again. Secret Rotation must be executed via the [Privileged Endpoint](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md) and requires Azure Stack Hub Operator credentials. If you don't know whether secret rotation has been run on your environment, update to 1811 before performing secret rotation.
    > - You don't need to rotate secrets to add extension host certificates. You should follow the instructions in the article [Prepare for extension host for Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-extension-host-prepare.md) to add extension host certificates.
    ::: moniker-end

2. Notify your users of planned maintenance operations. Schedule normal maintenance windows, as much as possible,  during non-business hours. Maintenance operations may affect both user workloads and portal operations.

3. [Generate certificate signing requests for Azure Stack Hub](../operator/azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md?view=azs-2206&tabs=omit-cn&pivots=csr-type-renewal&preserve-view=true).

4. [Prepare Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates](../operator/azure-stack-prepare-pki-certs.md).

5. During rotation of secrets, operators may notice alerts open and automatically close. This behavior is expected and the alerts can be ignored. Operators can verify the validity of these alerts using the [Test-AzureStack PowerShell cmdlet](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md). For operators, using System Center Operations Manager to monitor Azure Stack Hub systems, placing a system in maintenance mode will prevent these alerts from reaching their ITSM systems. However, alerts will continue to come if the Azure Stack Hub system becomes unreachable.

## Rotate external secrets

> [!Important]
> External secret rotation for:
> - **Non-certificate secrets such as secure keys and strings** must be done manually by the administrator. This includes user and administrator account passwords, and [network switch passwords](azure-stack-customer-defined.md).
> - **Value-add resource provider (RP) secrets** is covered under separate guidance:
>    - [App Service on Azure Stack Hub](app-service-rotate-certificates.md)
>    - [Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub](event-hubs-rp-rotate-secrets.md)
>    - [MySQL on Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-mysql-resource-provider-maintain.md#secrets-rotation)
>    - [SQL on Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-maintain.md#secrets-rotation)
> - **Baseboard management controller (BMC) credentials** is a manual process, [covered later in this article](#update-the-bmc-credential).
> - **Azure Container Registry** external certificates is a manual process, [covered later in this article](../operator/azure-stack-rotate-secrets.md#preparation).

This section covers rotation of certificates used to secure external-facing services. These certificates are provided by the Azure Stack Hub Operator, for the following services:

- Administrator portal
- Public portal
- Administrator Azure Resource Manager
- Global Azure Resource Manager
- Administrator Key Vault
- Key Vault
- Admin Extension Host
- ACS (including blob, table, and queue storage)
- ADFS<sup>1</sup>
- Graph<sup>1</sup>
- Container Registry<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup>Applicable when using Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS).

<sup>2</sup>Applicable when using Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### Preparation

Prior to rotation of external secrets:

1. Run the **[`Test-AzureStack`](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md)** PowerShell cmdlet using the `-group SecretRotationReadiness` parameter, to confirm all test outputs are healthy before rotating secrets.
2. Prepare a new set of replacement external certificates:
   - The new set must match the certificate specifications outlined in the [Azure Stack Hub PKI certificate requirements](azure-stack-pki-certs.md). 
   - Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) to submit to your Certificate Authority (CA). Use the steps outlined in [Generate certificate signing requests](../operator/azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md?view=azs-2206&tabs=omit-cn&pivots=csr-type-renewal&preserve-view=true) and prepare them for use in your Azure Stack Hub environment using the steps in [Prepare PKI certificates](azure-stack-prepare-pki-certs.md). Azure Stack Hub supports secret rotation for external certificates from a new Certificate Authority (CA) in the following contexts:

     |Rotate from CA|Rotate to CA|Azure Stack Hub version support|
     |-----|-----|-----|-----|
     |Self-Signed|Enterprise| 1903 & later|
     |Self-Signed|Self-Signed|Not Supported|
     |Self-Signed|Public<sup>*</sup>|1803 & later|
     |Enterprise|Enterprise|1803 & later; 1803-1903 if SAME enterprise CA as used at deployment|
     |Enterprise|Self-Signed|Not Supported|
     |Enterprise|Public<sup>*</sup>|1803 & later|
     |Public<sup>*</sup>|Enterprise|1903 & later|
     |Public<sup>*</sup>|Self-Signed|Not Supported|
     |Public<sup>*</sup>|Public<sup>*</sup>|1803 & later|

     <sup>*</sup>Part of the [Windows Trusted Root Program](/security/trusted-root/participants-list).

   - Be sure to validate the certificates you prepare with the steps outlined in [Validate PKI Certificates](azure-stack-validate-pki-certs.md)
   - Make sure there are no special characters in the password, like for example `$`,`*`,`#`,`@`,` or `)`.
   - Make sure the PFX encryption is **TripleDES-SHA1**. If you run into an issue, see [Fix common issues with Azure Stack Hub PKI certificates](azure-stack-remediate-certs.md#pfx-encryption).

3. Store a backup to the certificates used for rotation in a secure backup location. If your rotation runs and then fails, replace the certificates in the fileshare with the backup copies before you rerun the rotation. Keep backup copies in the secure backup location.
4. Create a fileshare you can access from the ERCS VMs. The fileshare must be readable and writable for the **CloudAdmin** identity.
5. Open a PowerShell ISE console from a computer where you have access to the fileshare. Navigate to your fileshare, where you create directories to place your external certificates.
6. Create a folder in the file share named `Certificates`. Inside the certificates folder, create a subfolder named `AAD` or `ADFS`, depending on the identity provider your Hub uses. For example, ***.\Certificates\AAD*** or ***.\Certificates\ADFS***. No other folders besides the certificates folder and the identity provider subfolder should be created here.
7. Copy the new set of replacement external certificates created in step #2, to the **.\Certificates\\\<IdentityProvider>** folder created in step #6. As mentioned above, your identity provider subfolder must either be `AAD` or `ADFS`. Please ensure that the subject alternative names (SANs) of your replacement external certificates follow the `cert.<regionName>.<externalFQDN>` format specified in [Azure Stack Hub public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate requirements](../operator/azure-stack-pki-certs.md#mandatory-certificates).

    Here's an example of a folder structure for the Azure AD Identity Provider:

    ```powershell
        <ShareName>
            │
            └───Certificates
                  └───AAD
                      ├───ACSBlob
                      │       <CertName>.pfx
                      │
                      ├───ACSQueue
                      │       <CertName>.pfx
                      │
                      ├───ACSTable

                      │
                      ├───KeyVaultInternal
                      │       <CertName>.pfx
                      │
                      ├───Public Extension Host
                      │       <CertName>.pfx
                      │
                      └───Public Portal
                              <CertName>.pfx
    ```

<sup>*</sup>Applicable when using Azure Container Registry (ACR) for AAD and ADFS.

>[!NOTE]
> If you are rotating external Container Registry certificates you must manually create a **`Container Registry`** subfolder in the identity provider subfolder. Additionally, you must store the corresponding .pfx certificate within this manually created subfolder.

### Rotation

Complete the following steps to rotate external secrets:

1. Use the following PowerShell script to rotate the secrets. The script requires access to a Privileged EndPoint (PEP) session. The PEP is accessed through a remote PowerShell session on the virtual machine (VM) that hosts the PEP. If you're using an integrated system, there are three instances of the PEP, each running inside a VM (Prefix-ERCS01, Prefix-ERCS02, or Prefix-ERCS03) on different hosts. The script performs the following steps:

   - Creates a PowerShell Session with the [Privileged endpoint](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md) using the **CloudAdmin** account, and stores the session as a variable. This variable is used as a parameter in the next step.  
   - Runs [Invoke-Command](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/Invoke-Command), passing the PEP session variable as the `-Session` parameter.  
   - Runs `Start-SecretRotation` in the PEP session, using the following parameters. For more information, see the [Start-SecretRotation](#reference-start-secretrotation-cmdlet) reference:  

     | Parameter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Variable | Description |
     | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
     | `-PfxFilesPath` | $CertSharePath | The network path to your certificates root folder as discussed in step #6 of the [Preparation section](#preparation), for example `\\<IPAddress>\<ShareName>\Certificates`. |
     | `-PathAccessCredential` | $CertShareCreds | The PSCredential object for credentials to the share. |
     | `-CertificatePassword`  | $CertPassword | A secure string of the password used for all of the pfx certificate files created. |

    ```powershell
    # Create a PEP session
    winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts= "<IP_address_of_ERCS>"}'
    $PEPCreds = Get-Credential
    $PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP_address_of_ERCS_Machine> -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

    # Run secret rotation
    $CertPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<Cert_Password>' -AsPlainText -Force
    $CertShareCreds = Get-Credential
    $CertSharePath = "<Network_Path_Of_CertShare>"
    Invoke-Command -Session $PEPsession -ScriptBlock {
        param($CertSharePath, $CertPassword, $CertShareCreds )
        Start-SecretRotation -PfxFilesPath $CertSharePath -PathAccessCredential $CertShareCreds -CertificatePassword $CertPassword
    } -ArgumentList ($CertSharePath, $CertPassword, $CertShareCreds)
    Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
    ```

2. External secret rotation takes approximately one hour. After successful completion, your console will display a `ActionPlanInstanceID ... CurrentStatus: Completed` message, followed by `Action plan finished with status: 'Completed'`. Remove your certificates from the share created in the Preparation section and store them in their secure backup location.

    > [!Note]
    > If secret rotation fails, follow the instructions in the error message and re-run `Start-SecretRotation` with the `-ReRun` parameter.
    >
    >```powershell
    >Start-SecretRotation -ReRun
    >```  
    >
    >Contact support if you experience repeated secret rotation failures.

3. Optionally, to confirm that all external certificates were rotated, run the [**Test-AzureStack** validation tool](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md) using the following script:

    ```powershell
    Test-AzureStack -Include AzsExternalCertificates -DetailedResults -debug
    ```

::: moniker-end

## Rotate internal secrets

Internal secrets include certificates, passwords, secure strings, and keys used by the Azure Stack Hub infrastructure, without intervention of the Azure Stack Hub Operator. Internal secret rotation is only required if you suspect one has been compromised, or you've received an expiration alert. 
::: moniker range="<azs-1811"  
Pre-1811 deployments may see alerts for pending internal certificate or secret expirations. These alerts are inaccurate and should be ignored, and are a known issue resolved in 1811.
::: moniker-end

Complete the following steps to rotate internal secrets:

1. Run the following PowerShell script. Notice for internal secret rotation, the "Run Secret Rotation" section uses only the `-Internal` parameter to the [Start-SecretRotation cmdlet](../reference/pep/start-secretrotation.md):

    ```powershell
    # Create a PEP Session
    winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts= "<IP_address_of_ERCS>"}'
    $PEPCreds = Get-Credential
    $PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP_address_of_ERCS_Machine> -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

    # Run Secret Rotation
    Invoke-Command -Session $PEPSession -ScriptBlock {
        Start-SecretRotation -Internal
    }
    Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
    ```

    ::: moniker range="<azs-1811"
    > [!Note]
    > Pre-1811 versions don't require the `-Internal` flag. 
    ::: moniker-end


2. After successful completion, your console will display a `ActionPlanInstanceID ... CurrentStatus: Completed` message, followed by `Action plan finished with status: 'Completed'`.

    > [!Note]
    > If secret rotation fails, follow the instructions in the error message and rerun `Start-SecretRotation` with the  `-Internal` and `-ReRun` parameters.  
    >
    >```powershell
    >Start-SecretRotation -Internal -ReRun
    >```
    >
    > Contact support if you experience repeated secret rotation failures.

### Rotate Azure Stack Hub root certificate

The Azure Stack Hub root certificate is provisioned during deployment with an expiration of five years. Starting with 2108, internal secret rotation also rotates the root certificate. The standard secret expiration alert identifies the expiry of the root certificate and generates alerts at both 90 (warning) and 30 (critical) days.

To rotate the root certificate, you must update your system to 2108 and perform [internal secret rotation](#rotate-internal-secrets).

The following code snippet uses the Privileged Endpoint to list the expiration date of the root certificate:

```powershell
$pep = New-PSSession -ComputerName <ip address> -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $cred -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US) 
 
$stampInfo = Invoke-Command -Session $pep -ScriptBlock { Get-AzureStackStampInformation }

$rootCert = $stampInfo.RootCACertificates| Sort-Object -Property NotAfter | Select-Object -Last 1
"The Azure Stack Hub Root Certificate expires on {0}" -f $rootCert.NotAfter.ToString("D") | Write-Host -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

## Update the BMC credential

The baseboard management controller monitors the physical state of your servers. Refer to your original equipment manufacturer (OEM) hardware vendor for instructions to update the user account name and password of the BMC.

>[!NOTE]
> Your OEM may provide additional management apps. Updating the user name or password for other management apps has no effect on the BMC user name or password. 

::: moniker range="<azs-1910"
1. Update the BMC on the Azure Stack Hub physical servers by following your OEM instructions. The user name and password for each BMC in your environment must be the same. The BMC user names can't exceed 16 characters.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azs-1910"
1. It's no longer required that you first update the BMC credentials on the Azure Stack Hub physical servers by following your OEM instructions. The user name and password for each BMC in your environment must be the same, and can't exceed 16 characters. 
::: moniker-end

2. Open a privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Hub sessions. For instructions, see [Using the privileged endpoint in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md). 

3. After opening a privileged endpoint session, run one of the PowerShell scripts below, which use Invoke-Command to run Set-BmcCredential. If you use the optional -BypassBMCUpdate parameter with Set-BMCCredential, credentials in the BMC aren't updated. Only the Azure Stack Hub internal datastore is updated. Pass your privileged endpoint session variable as a parameter.

    Here's an example PowerShell script that will prompt for user name and password: 

    ```powershell
    # Interactive Version
    $PEPIp = "<Privileged Endpoint IP or Name>" # You can also use the machine name instead of IP here.
    $PEPCreds = Get-Credential "<Domain>\CloudAdmin" -Message "PEP Credentials"
    $NewBmcPwd = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter New BMC password" -AsSecureString
    $NewBmcUser = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter New BMC user name"

    $PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $PEPIp -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

    Invoke-Command -Session $PEPSession -ScriptBlock {
        # Parameter BmcPassword is mandatory, while the BmcUser parameter is optional.
        Set-BmcCredential -BmcPassword $using:NewBmcPwd -BmcUser $using:NewBmcUser
    }
    Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
    ```

    You can also encode the user name and password in variables, which may be less secure:

    ```powershell
    # Static Version
    $PEPIp = "<Privileged Endpoint IP or Name>" # You can also use the machine name instead of IP here.
    $PEPUser = "<Privileged Endpoint user for example Domain\CloudAdmin>"
    $PEPPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString '<Privileged Endpoint Password>' -AsPlainText -Force
    $PEPCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($PEPUser, $PEPPwd)
    $NewBmcPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString '<New BMC Password>' -AsPlainText -Force
    $NewBmcUser = "<New BMC User name>"

    $PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $PEPIp -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

    Invoke-Command -Session $PEPSession -ScriptBlock {
        # Parameter BmcPassword is mandatory, while the BmcUser parameter is optional.
        Set-BmcCredential -BmcPassword $using:NewBmcPwd -BmcUser $using:NewBmcUser
    }
    Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
    ```

## Reference: Start-SecretRotation cmdlet

[Start-SecretRotation cmdlet](../reference/pep/start-secretrotation.md) rotates the infrastructure secrets of an Azure Stack Hub system. This cmdlet can only be executed against the Azure Stack Hub privileged endpoint, by using an  `Invoke-Command` script block passing the PEP session in the `-Session` parameter. By default, it rotates only the certificates of all external network infrastructure endpoints.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Position | Default | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| `PfxFilesPath` | String  | False  | Named  | None  | The fileshare path to the **\Certificates** root folder containing all external network endpoint certificates. Only required when rotating external secrets. Path must end with **\Certificates** folder, for example **\\\\\<IPAddress>\\\<ShareName>\\Certificates**. |
| `CertificatePassword` | SecureString | False  | Named  | None  | The password for all certificates provided in the -PfXFilesPath. Required value if PfxFilesPath is provided when external secrets are rotated. |
| `Internal` | String | False | Named | None | Internal flag must be used anytime an Azure Stack Hub operator wishes to rotate internal infrastructure secrets. |
| `PathAccessCredential` | PSCredential | False  | Named  | None  | The PowerShell credential for the fileshare of the **\Certificates** directory containing all external network endpoint certificates. Only required when rotating external secrets.  |
| `ReRun` | SwitchParameter | False  | Named  | None  | Must be used anytime secret rotation is reattempted after a failed attempt. |

### Syntax

#### For external secret rotation

```powershell
Start-SecretRotation [-PfxFilesPath <string>] [-PathAccessCredential <PSCredential>] [-CertificatePassword <SecureString>]  
```

#### For internal secret rotation

```powershell
Start-SecretRotation [-Internal]  
```

#### For external secret rotation rerun

```powershell
Start-SecretRotation [-ReRun]
```

#### For internal secret rotation rerun

```powershell
Start-SecretRotation [-ReRun] [-Internal]
```

### Examples

#### Rotate only internal infrastructure secrets

This command must be run via your Azure Stack Hub [environment's privileged endpoint](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md).

```powershell
PS C:\> Start-SecretRotation -Internal
```

This command rotates all of the infrastructure secrets exposed to the Azure Stack Hub internal network.

#### Rotate only external infrastructure secrets  

```powershell
# Create a PEP Session
winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts= "<IP_address_of_ERCS>"}'
$PEPCreds = Get-Credential
$PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP_address_of_ERCS> -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)

# Create Credentials for the fileshare
$CertPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<CertPasswordHere>' -AsPlainText -Force
$CertShareCreds = Get-Credential
$CertSharePath = "<NetworkPathOfCertShare>"
# Run Secret Rotation
Invoke-Command -Session $PEPsession -ScriptBlock {
    param($CertSharePath, $CertPassword, $CertShareCreds )
    Start-SecretRotation -PfxFilesPath $CertSharePath -PathAccessCredential $CertShareCreds -CertificatePassword $CertPassword
} -ArgumentList ($CertSharePath, $CertPassword, $CertShareCreds)
Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
```

This command rotates the TLS certificates used for Azure Stack Hub's external network infrastructure endpoints.

::: moniker range="<azs-1811"
#### Rotate internal and external infrastructure secrets (**pre-1811** only)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command only applies to Azure Stack Hub **pre-1811** as the rotation has been split for internal and external certificates.
>
> **From *1811+* you can't rotate both internal and external certificates anymore!**

```powershell
# Create a PEP Session
winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts= "<IP_address_of_ERCS>"}'
$PEPCreds = Get-Credential
$PEPSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName <IP_address_of_ERCS> -Credential $PEPCreds -ConfigurationName "PrivilegedEndpoint" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US)
# Create Credentials for the fileshare
$CertPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<CertPasswordHere>' -AsPlainText -Force
$CertShareCreds = Get-Credential
$CertSharePath = "<NetworkPathOfCertShare>"
# Run Secret Rotation
Invoke-Command -Session $PEPSession -ScriptBlock {
    Start-SecretRotation -PfxFilesPath $using:CertSharePath -PathAccessCredential $using:CertShareCreds -CertificatePassword $using:CertPassword
}
Remove-PSSession -Session $PEPSession
```

This command rotates the infrastructure secrets exposed to Azure Stack Hub internal network, and the TLS certificates used for Azure Stack Hub's external network infrastructure endpoints. Start-SecretRotation rotates all stack-generated secrets, and because there are provided certificates, external endpoint certificates will also be rotated.
