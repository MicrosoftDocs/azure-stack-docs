# Add a new Azure Stack Hub user account in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

You can use the **Active Directory Users and Computers** snap-in to add additional users to an Azure Stack Hub environment, using AD FS as its identity provider.

## Add Windows Server Active Directory users

1. Sign in to a computer with an account that provides access to the Windows Administrative Tools and open a new Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
2. Select **File > Add or remove snap-in**.

   > [!TIP]
   > Replace *directory-domain* with the domain that matches your directory. 

3. Select **Active Directory Users and Computers** > *directory-domain* > **Users**.
4. Select **Action** > **New** > **User**.
5. In New Object - User, provide user details. Select **Next**.
6. Provide and confirm a password.
7. Select **Next** to complete the values. Select **Finish** to create the user.
