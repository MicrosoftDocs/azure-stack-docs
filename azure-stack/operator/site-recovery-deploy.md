# Deployment overview (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the public preview of Azure Site Recovery on Azure Stack Hub, updates might require a complete re-installation (a complete removal and then re-add) of the service.

To enable replication of virtual machines (VMs) across two Azure Stack Hub environments, you must configure the following environments:

- The **source** environment. The Azure Stack Hub environment in which user VMs (the actual workloads you want to protect) are running.
- The **target** environment. The environment in which the Azure Site Recovery resource provider and dependencies run.

During the public preview, Microsoft will release serveral versions for both the service RPs and the extensions. The following is the complete list of currently available images:

The process to install Azure Site Recovery includes actions from both the Azure Stack Hub operator and the Azure Stack Hub user:

## Operators

Operators must perform the following steps:

- Source: prepare the environment.
  - Download the **Azure Site Recovery appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image and the respective **Azure Site Recovery â€“ extensions** in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace Management.
  - Ensure that Azure Stack Hub users can deploy the **ASR appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in their respective Azure Stack Hub user subscriptions (where the VM workloads run).
- Target: prepare the environment by installing Site Recovery services and dependencies, ensuring the right quotas are assigned to the respective plans and offers where Site Recovery will be used.

## Users

Users must perform the following steps:

- Source:
  - Deploy the **ASR appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in the Azure Stack Hub user subscription.
  - The user must have owner rights on each Azure Stack Hub user subscription in which they protect VM workloads.
- Target:
  - Deploy the Azure Site Recovery Vault.
  - Create the protection policies and enable the protection of the workloads.
