# Deployment overview

To enable replication of virtual machines (VMs) across two Azure Stack Hub environments, you must configure the following environments:

- The **source** environment. The Azure Stack Hub environment in which user VMs (the actual workloads you want to protect) are running.
- The **target** environment. The environment in which the Azure Site Recovery resource provider runs.

The following is the complete list of currently available images:

The process to install Azure Site Recovery includes actions from both the Azure Stack Hub operator and the Azure Stack Hub user:

## Operators

Operators must perform the following steps:

- Ensure that required networking requirements are in place for both **source** and **target** environments.
- Source: prepare the environment.
  - Download the **Azure Site Recovery appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image and the respective **Azure Site Recovery â€“ extensions** in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace Management.
  - Ensure that Azure Stack Hub users can deploy the **ASR appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in their respective Azure Stack Hub user subscriptions (where the VM workloads run).
- Target: prepare the environment by installing Site Recovery services, ensuring the right quotas are assigned to the respective plans and offers where Site Recovery will be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The Target User-subscription needs to have sufficient quotas assigned to enable the creation for the VMs that are planned to fail-over. While preparing the target environment, please consider that all the workloads you will plan to potentially failover, will need to run in that environment.


## Users

Users must perform the following steps:

- Source:
  - Deploy the **Azure Site Recovery appliance on AzureStack Hub** VM image in the Azure Stack Hub user subscription.
  - The user must have owner rights on each Azure Stack Hub user subscription in which they protect VM workloads.
- Target:
  - Deploy the Azure Site Recovery Vault.
  - Create the protection policies and enable the protection of the workloads.

## Networking requirements

Because the source and target Azure Stack Hubs might be in different datacenters, regions, or security boundaries, the Azure Stack Hub operator must make sure the networking connectivity is in place and configured in order for the Azure Site Recovery services to function:

- Name resolution
  - The Azure Site Recovery appliance running on the **source** Azure Stack Hub instance must be able to resolve the FQDN of the **target** Azure Stack Hub instance.
- The Azure Site Recovery appliance running on the **source** Azure Stack Hub instance should be able to access the following ports on the source site:
  - (When in use) Microsoft Entra ID: *.microsoftonline.com:443
  - (When in use) AD FS: adfs.< external-FQDN >:443
  - Azure Resource Manager: management.< external-FQDN >:443
- The Azure Site Recovery appliance must be able to access the following ports of the **target** Azure Stack Hub instance:
  - (When in use) Microsoft Entra ID: *.microsoftonline.com:443
  - (When in use) AD FS: adfs.< external-FQDN >:443
  - Azure Resource Manager: management.< external-FQDN >:443
  - Blob: *.blob.< external-FQDN >:443
  - Azure Site Recovery: rp.asr.< external-FQDN >:8478,8479,44307
