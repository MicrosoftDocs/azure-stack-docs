# Azure Stack Hub hotfix 1.2206.2.52

## Summary

- Improved stability of SDN components.
- Improved the PnP device attached alert and moved it back to Preview.
- Fixed an issue that could cause excessive disk space usage on infra VMs and hosts.
- Fixed an issue in which scaling a VMSS in and out would eventually fill a subnet's IP address space.
- Removed IIS default website to prevent server IP address leak vulnerability.
- Fixed an issue that was blocking the update from 2108 to the 2206 build due to **MetadataServer** being unhealthy.
- Fixed an issue that could lead to a **BlobSasManager** service crash during VM deletion.
- Improvements to support tools.

## Fixes rolled up from previous hotfix releases

- Fixed an issue in the Virtual Machine Scale Set portal creation experience that caused the addition of an existing load balancer to fail.
- Removed unsupported **Reapply** feature in the virtual machine portal experience.
- Fixed an issue in which the infrastructure backup information displayed on the portal is not consistent with the alert.
- Improved blob metadata backup stability by skipping unnecessary dependency.

- Fixed a null reference issue when calling the Compute Resource Provider API to power off a virtual machine without doing a shutdown.
