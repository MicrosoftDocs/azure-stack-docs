# Azure Stack Hub hotfix 1.2206.2.43

## Summary

- Improved stability of SDN components.

## Fixes rolled up from previous hotfix releases

- Fixed an issue in the Virtual Machine Scale Set portal creation experience that caused the addition of an existing load balancer to fail.
- Removed unsupported **Reapply** feature in the virtual machine portal experience.
