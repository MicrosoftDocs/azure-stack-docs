If you are a CSP, the following error messages can occur when [adding tenants](azure-stack-csp-ref-operations.md#add-tenant-to-registration) to a registration for reporting usage against the customer's Azure subscription ID.

## List of registration error codes

| **RegistrationNotFound**            | The provided registration was not found. Make sure the following information was provided correctly:<br>1. Subscription identifier (value provided: **subscription identifier**),<br>2. Resource group (value provided: **resource group**),<br>3. Registration name (value provided: **registration name**).                             | This error usually occurs when the information pointing to the initial registration is not correct. If you need to verify the resource group and name of your registration, you can find it in the Azure portal, by listing all resources. If you find more than one registration resource, look at the **CloudDeploymentID** in the properties, and select the registration whose **CloudDeploymentID** matches that of your cloud. To find the **CloudDeploymentID**, you can use this PowerShell command on Azure Stack Hub:<br>`$azureStackStampInfo = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-AzureStackStampInformation }` |
| **BadCustomerSubscriptionId**       | The provided **customer subscription identifier** and the **registration name** subscription identifier are not owned by the same Microsoft CSP. Check that the customer subscription identifier is correct. If the problem persists, contact support. | This error occurs when the customer subscription is a CSP subscription, but it rolls up to a CSP partner different from the one to which the subscription used in the initial registration rolls up. This check is made to prevent a situation that would result in billing a CSP partner who is not responsible for the Azure Stack Hub used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **InvalidCustomerSubscriptionId**   | The **customer subscription identifier** is not valid. Make sure a valid Azure subscription is provided.                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **CustomerSubscriptionNotFound**    | **Customer subscription identifier** was not found under **registration name**. Make sure a valid Azure subscription is being used and that the subscription ID was added to the registration using the PUT operation.                                                   | This error occurs when trying to verity that a tenant has been added to a subscription, and the customer subscription is not found to be associated with the registration. The customer has not been added to the registration, or the subscription ID has been written incorrectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **CustomerSubscriptionsNotAllowed** | Customer subscription operations are not supported for disconnected customers. In order to use this feature, re-register with Pay As You Use licensing.                                                                                                                                                                    | The registration to which you are trying to add tenants is a capacity registration; that is, when the registration was created, the parameter `BillingModel Capacity` was used. Only pay-as-you-use registrations are allowed to add tenants. You must re-register using the parameter `BillingModel PayAsYouUse`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **InvalidCSPSubscription**          | The provided **customer subscription identifier** is not a valid CSP subscription. Make sure a valid Azure subscription is provided.                                                                                                                                                        | This is most likely due to the customer subscription being mistyped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
