# Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub operator overview

Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub allows you to realize hybrid cloud scenarios. Streaming and event-based solutions are supported, for both on-premises and Azure cloud processing. Whether your scenario is hybrid (connected), or disconnected, your solution can support processing of events/streams at large scale. Your scenario is bound only by cluster size, which you can provision according to your needs. 

## Features

See the [Azure Stack Hub User documentation](../user/event-hubs-overview.md) for a feature comparison, between Event Hubs on Azure Stack vs. Azure Event Hubs.

## Feature documentation

To learn more about the Event Hubs user experience, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs documentation](/azure/event-hubs/). This documentation applies to both editions of Event Hubs, and contains topics such as:

- Details on [Event Hubs concepts](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features)
- How to [create an Event Hubs cluster and namespace](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal)
- How to create an [event hub](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hub)
- How to stream [using the Kafka protocol](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quickstart-kafka-enabled-event-hubs)


## Next steps

Review [Capacity planning for Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub](event-hubs-rp-capacity-planning.md), before beginning the installation process. Understanding capacity planning will help you ensure your users have the capacity they require.
