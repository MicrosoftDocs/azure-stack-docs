# Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub overview

Event Hubs on Azure Stack Hub allows you to realize hybrid cloud scenarios. Streaming and event-based solutions are supported, for both on-premises and Azure cloud processing. Whether your scenario is hybrid (connected), or disconnected, your solution can support processing of events/streams at large scale. Your scenario is only bound by the Event Hubs Cluster size, which you can provision according to your needs. 

## Features

See the [Azure Stack Hub User documentation](/azure-stack/user/event-hubs-overview) for a feature comparison, between Event Hubs on Azure Stack vs. Azure Event Hubs.

## Feature documentation

To learn more about the Event Hubs user experience, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs documentation](/azure/event-hubs/). This documentation applies to both editions of Event Hubs, and contains topics on using Event Hubs and activities such as:

- Details on [Event Hubs concepts](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features)
- How to [create an Event Hubs cluster and namespace](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal)
