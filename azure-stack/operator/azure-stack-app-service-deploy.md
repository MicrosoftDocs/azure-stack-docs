# Deploy App Service in Azure Stack Hub

[!INCLUDE [Azure Stack hub update reminder](../includes/app-service-hub-update-banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you run the resource provider installer, you must complete the steps in [Before you get started](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md)

::: zone pivot="state-connected"
In this article you learn how to deploy App Service in Azure Stack Hub, which gives your users the ability to create Web, API and Azure Functions applications. You need to:

- Add the [App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-overview.md) to your Azure Stack Hub deployment using the steps described in this article.
- After you install the App Service resource provider, you can include it in your offers and plans. Users can then subscribe to get the service and start creating apps.

# [Azure App Service on Azure Stack 2022 H1](#tab/22h1)

## Run the App Service resource provider installer

Installing the App Service resource provider takes at least an hour. The length of time needed depends on how many role instances you deploy. During the deployment, the installer runs the following tasks:

- Registers the required resource providers in the Default Provider Subscription
- Grants contributor access to the App Service Identity application
- Create Resource Group and Virtual network (if necessary)
- Create Storage accounts and containers for App Service installation artifacts, usage service, and resource hydration
- Download App Service artifacts and upload them to the App Service storage account
- Deploy the App Service
- Register the usage service
- Create DNS Entries for App Service
- Register the App Service admin and tenant resource providers
- Register Gallery Items - Web, API, Function App, App Service Plan, WordPress, DNN, Orchard, and Django applications

To deploy App Service resource provider, follow these steps:

1. Run appservice.exe as an admin from a computer that can access the Azure Stack Hub Admin Azure Resource Management Endpoint.

2. Select **Deploy App Service or upgrade to the latest version**.

    ![Screenshot showing the main screen of the Azure App Service installer.][1]

3. Review and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms and then select **Next**.

4. Review and accept the third-party license terms and then select **Next**.

5. Make sure that the App Service cloud configuration information is correct. If you used the default settings during ASDK deployment, you can accept the default values. But, if you customized the options when you deployed the ASDK, or are deploying on an Azure Stack Hub integrated system, you must edit the values in this window to reflect the differences.

   For example, if you use the domain suffix mycloud.com, your Azure Stack Hub Tenant Azure Resource Manager endpoint must change to management.&lt;region&gt;.mycloud.com. Review these settings, and then select **Next** to save the settings.

   ![Screenshot that shows the screen for specifying the ARM endpoints for the App Service.][2]

6. On the next App Service Installer page you will connect to your Azure Stack Hub:

    1. Select the connection method you wish to use - **Credential** or **Service Principal**
 
        - **Credential**
            - If you're using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), enter the Azure AD admin account and password that you provided when you deployed Azure Stack Hub. Select **Connect**.
            - If you're using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), provide your admin account. For example, cloudadmin@azurestack.local. Enter your password, and then select **Connect**.

        - **Service Principal**
            - The service principal that you use **must** have **Owner** rights on the **Default Provider Subscription**
            - Provide the **Service Principal ID**, **Certificate File**, and **Password** and select **Connect**.

    1. In **Azure Stack Hub Subscriptions**, select the **Default Provider Subscription**.  Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub **must** be deployed in the **Default Provider Subscription**.

    1. In the **Azure Stack Hub Locations**, select the location that corresponds to the region you're deploying to. For example, select **local** if you're deploying to the ASDK.

    1. Administrators can specify a three character **Deployment Prefix** for the individual instances in each Virtual Machine Scale Set that are deployed.  This is useful if managing multiple Azure Stack Hub instances.

    ![Screenshot that shows where you specify the Azure Stack Hub subscription information in the App Service installer.][13]

7. Now you can deploy into an existing virtual network that you configured [using these steps](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#virtual-network), or let the App Service installer create a new virtual network and subnets. To create a VNet, follow these steps:

   a. Select **Create VNet with default settings**, accept the defaults, and then select **Next**.

   b. Alternatively, select **Use existing VNet and Subnets**. Complete the following actions:

     - Select the **Resource Group** that contains your virtual network.
     - Choose the **Virtual Network** name that you want to deploy to.
     - Select the correct **Subnet** values for each of the required role subnets.
     - Select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you configure your virtual network in the App Service installer.][4]

8. Enter the info for your file share and then select **Next**. The address of the file share must use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or the IP address of your File Server. For example, \\\appservicefileserver.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external\websites, or \\\10.0.0.1\websites.  If you're using a file server, which is domain joined, you must provide the full username including domain. For example, myfileserverdomain\FileShareOwner.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The installer tries to test connectivity to the file share before proceeding. But, if you're deploying to an existing virtual network, this connectivity test might fail. You're given a warning and a prompt to continue. If the file share info is correct, continue the deployment.

   ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you configure your File Server paths and credentials in the App Service installer][5]

9. On the next App Service Installer page, follow these steps:

   a. In the **Identity Application ID** box, enter the GUID for the Identity application you created as part of the [pre-requisites](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md).

   b. In the **Identity Application certificate file** box, enter (or browse to) the location of the certificate file.

   c. In the **Identity Application certificate password** box, enter the password for the certificate. This password is the one that you made note of when you used the script to create the certificates.

   d. In the **Azure Resource Manager root certificate file** box, enter (or browse to) the location of the certificate file.

   e. Select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you provide the details of the AAD/ADFS Identity Application, and Azure Stack Resource Manager Certificate, in the App Service Installer][6]

10. For each of the three certificate file boxes, select **Browse** and navigate to the appropriate certificate file. You must provide the password for each certificate. These certificates are the ones that you created in [Prerequisites for deploying App Service on Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md). Select **Next** after entering all the information.

    | Box | Certificate file name example |
    | --- | --- |
    | **App Service default SSL certificate file** | \_.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |
    | **App Service API SSL certificate file** | api.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |
    | **App Service Publisher SSL certificate file** | ftp.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |

    If you used a different domain suffix when you created the certificates, your certificate file names don't use *local.AzureStack.external*. Instead, use your custom domain info.

    ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you provide the details of the required certificates in the App Service Installer][7]

11. Enter the SQL Server details for the server instance used to host the App Service resource provider database and then select **Next**. The installer validates the SQL connection properties.<br><br>The App Service installer tries to test connectivity to the SQL Server before proceeding. If you're deploying to an existing virtual network, this connectivity test might fail. You're given a warning and a prompt to continue. If the SQL Server info is correct, continue the deployment.

    ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you provide the connection details for SQL Server in the App Service Installer][8]

12. Review the role instance and SKU options. The defaults populate with the minimum number of instances and the minimum SKU for each role in a production deployment.  For ASDK deployment, you can scale the instances down to lower SKUs to reduce the core and memory commit but you will experience a performance degradation. A summary of vCPU and memory requirements is provided to help plan your deployment. After you make your selections, select **Next**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >For production deployments, following the guidance in [Capacity planning for Azure App Service server roles in Azure Stack Hub](azure-stack-app-service-capacity-planning.md).

    | Role | Minimum instances | Minimum SKU | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Controller | 2 | Standard_A4_v2 - (4 cores, 8192 MB) | Manages and maintains the health of the App Service cloud. |
    | Management | 1 | Standard_D3_v2 - (4 cores, 14336 MB) | Manages the App Service Azure Resource Manager and API endpoints, portal extensions (admin, tenant, Functions portal), and the data service. To support failover, increase the recommended instances to 2. |
    | Publisher | 1 | Standard_A2_v2 - (2 cores, 4096 MB) | Publishes content via FTP and web deployment. |
    | FrontEnd | 1 | Standard_A4_v2 - (4 cores, 8192 MB) | Routes requests to App Service apps. |
    | Shared Worker | 1 | Standard_A4_v2 - (4 cores, 8192 MB) | Hosts web or API apps and Azure Functions apps. You might want to add more instances. As an operator, you can define your offering and choose any SKU tier. The tiers must have a minimum of one vCPU. |

    ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you provide the number of role instances and their corresponding compute sku in the App Service Installer][9]

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Windows Server 2022 Core isn't a supported platform image for use with Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub.  Don't use evaluation images for production deployments.**

13. In the **Select Platform Image** box, choose your deployment Windows Server **2022** virtual machine (VM) image from the images available in the compute resource provider for the App Service cloud.  Select **Next**.

14. On the next App Service Installer page, follow these steps:

     a. Enter the Worker Role VM admin user name and password.

     b. Enter the Other Roles VM admin user name and password.

     c. Select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the screen where you select the Windows Platform Image to be used by the App Service Installer][10]

15. On the App Service Installer summary page, follow these steps:

    a. Verify the selections you made. To make changes, use the **Previous** buttons to visit previous pages.

    b. If the configurations are correct, select the check box.

    c. To start the deployment, select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the summary of the options specified for deployment by the App Service Installer][11]

16. On the next App Service Installer page, follow these steps:

    a. Track the installation progress. App Service on Azure Stack Hub can take up to 240 minutes to deploy based on the default selections and age of the base Windows 2016 Datacenter image.

    b. After the installer successfully finishes, select  **Exit**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the deployment progress made by the App Service Installer][12]

## Post-deployment Steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've provided the App Service RP with a SQL Always On Instance you **must** [add the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to an availability group](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database) and synchronize the databases to prevent any loss of service in the event of a database failover.

If you're deploying to an existing virtual network and using an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule. This rule enables SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. In the administrator portal, go to the WorkersNsg Network Security Group and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:

- Source: Any
- Source port range: *
- Destination: IP addresses
- Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
- Destination port range: 445
- Protocol: TCP
- Action: Allow
- Priority: 700
- Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

To remove latency when workers are communicating with the file server we also advise adding the following rule to the Worker NSG to allow outbound LDAP and Kerberos traffic to your Active Directory Controllers if securing the file server using Active Directory, for example if you have used the Quickstart template to deploy a HA File Server and SQL Server.

Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 - Source: Any
 - Source port range: *
 - Destination: IP Addresses
 - Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your AD Servers, for example with the Quickstart template 10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101
 - Destination port range: 389,88
 - Protocol: Any
 - Action: Allow
 - Priority: 710
 - Name: Outbound_Allow_LDAP_and_Kerberos_to_Domain_Controllers

## Validate the App Service on Azure Stack Hub installation

1. In the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal, go to **Administration - App Service**.

2. In the overview, under status, check to see that the **Status** displays **All roles are ready**.

    ![App Service administration in the Azure Stack Hub Administration Portal](media/azure-stack-app-service-deploy/image12.png)

## Test drive App Service on Azure Stack Hub

After you deploy and register the App Service resource provider, test it to make sure that users can deploy web and API apps.

>[!NOTE]
>You need to create an offer that has the Microsoft.Web namespace in the plan. You also need a tenant subscription that subscribes to the offer. For more info, see [Create offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) and [Create plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md).
>
>You *must* have a tenant subscription to create apps that use App Service on Azure Stack Hub. The only tasks that a service admin can complete in the administrator portal are related to the resource provider administration of App Service. This includes adding capacity, configuring deployment sources, and adding Worker tiers and SKUs.
>
>To create web, API, and Azure Functions apps, you must use the user portal and have a tenant subscription.
>

To create a test web app, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure Stack Hub user portal, select **+ Create a resource** > **Web + Mobile** > **Web App**.

2. Under **Web App**, enter a name in **Web app**.

3. Under **Resource Group**, select **New**. Enter a name for  the **Resource Group**.

4. Select **App Service plan/Location** > **Create New**.

5. Under **App Service plan**, enter a name for the **App Service plan**.

6. Select **Pricing tier** > **Free-Shared** or **Shared-Shared** > **Select** > **OK** > **Create**.

7. A tile for the new web app appears on the dashboard. Select the tile.

8. On **Web App**, select **Browse** to view the default website for this app.

## Deploy a WordPress, DNN, or Django website (optional)

1. In the Azure Stack Hub user portal, select **+**, go to the Azure Marketplace, deploy a Django website, and then wait for the deployment to finish. The Django web platform uses a file system-based database. It doesn't require any additional resource providers, such as SQL or MySQL.

2. If you also deployed a MySQL resource provider, you can deploy a WordPress website from the Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, enter the user name as *User1\@Server1*, with the user name and server name of your choice.

3. If you also deployed a SQL Server resource provider, you can deploy a DNN website from the Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, choose a database in the computer running SQL Server that's connected to your resource provider.

In this article you learn how to deploy the [Azure App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-overview.md) to an Azure Stack Hub environment that is:
- Not connected to the internet.
- Secured by Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

To add the Azure App Service resource provider to your offline Azure Stack Hub deployment, you must complete these top-level tasks:

1. Complete the [prerequisite steps](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md) (like purchasing certificates, which can take a few days to receive).
2. [Download and extract the installation and helper files](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md) to a machine that's connected to the internet.
3. Create an offline installation package.
4. Run the appservice.exe installer file.

## Create an offline installation package

To deploy Azure App Service in an offline environment, first create an offline installation package on a machine that's connected to the internet.

1. Run the AppService.exe installer on a machine that's connected to the internet. 

2. Select **Advanced** > **Create offline installation package**. This step will take several minutes to complete.

    ![Create an offline package in Azure App Service Installer][13]

3. The Azure App Service installer creates an offline installation package and displays the path to it. You can select **Open folder** to open the folder in File Explorer.

## Post-deployment steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've provided the Azure App Service RP with a SQL Always On Instance, you **must** [add the appservice_hosting and appservice_metering databases to an availability group](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database). You must also synchronize the databases to prevent any loss of service in the event of a database failover.

If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. In the administrator portal, go to the WorkersNsg Network Security Group and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:

- Source: Any
- Source port range: *
- Destination: IP addresses
- Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
- Destination port range: 445
- Protocol: TCP
- Action: Allow
- Priority: 700
- Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

To remove latency when workers are communicating with the file server we also advise adding the following rule to the Worker NSG to allow outbound LDAP and Kerberos traffic to your Active Directory Controllers if securing the file server using Active Directory, for example if you have used the Quickstart template to deploy a HA File Server and SQL Server.

Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 - Source: Any
 - Source port range: *
 - Destination: IP Addresses
 - Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your AD Servers, for example with the Quickstart template 10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101
 - Destination port range: 389,88
 - Protocol: Any
 - Action: Allow
 - Priority: 710
 - Name: Outbound_Allow_LDAP_and_Kerberos_to_Domain_Controllers

## Validate the Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub installation

1. In the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal, go to **Administration - App Service**.

1. In the overview, under status, check to see that the **Status** displays **All roles are ready**.

## Test drive Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

After you deploy and register the Azure App Service resource provider, test it to make sure that users can deploy web and API apps.

> [!NOTE]
> You must create an offer that has the Microsoft.Web namespace within the plan. Then, you need to have a tenant subscription that subscribes to this offer. For more info, see [Create offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) and [Create plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md).
>
> You *must* have a tenant subscription to create apps that use Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub. The only capabilities that a service admin can complete within the administrator portal are related to the resource provider administration of Azure App Service. These capabilities include adding capacity, configuring deployment sources, and adding Worker tiers and SKUs.
>
> As of the third technical preview, to create web, API, and Azure Functions apps, you must use the user portal and have a tenant subscription.

- Source: Any
- Source port range: *
- Destination: IP addresses
- Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
- Destination port range: 445
- Protocol: TCP
- Action: Allow
- Priority: 700
- Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

To remove latency when workers are communicating with the file server we also advise adding the following rule to the Worker NSG to allow outbound LDAP and Kerberos traffic to your Active Directory Controllers if securing the file server using Active Directory, for example if you have used the Quickstart template to deploy a HA File Server and SQL Server.

Go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 - Source: Any
 - Source port range: *
 - Destination: IP Addresses
 - Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your AD Servers, for example with the Quickstart template 10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101
 - Destination port range: 389,88
 - Protocol: Any
 - Action: Allow
 - Priority: 710
 - Name: Outbound_Allow_LDAP_and_Kerberos_to_Domain_Controllers

## Validate the Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub installation

1. In the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal, go to **Administration - App Service**.

1. In the overview, under status, check to see that the **Status** displays **All roles are ready**.

## Test drive Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub

After you deploy and register the Azure App Service resource provider, test it to make sure that users can deploy web and API apps.

> [!NOTE]
> You must create an offer that has the Microsoft.Web namespace within the plan. Then, you need to have a tenant subscription that subscribes to this offer. For more info, see [Create offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) and [Create plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md).
>
> You *must* have a tenant subscription to create apps that use Azure App Service on Azure Stack Hub. The only capabilities that a service admin can complete within the administrator portal are related to the resource provider administration of Azure App Service. These capabilities include adding capacity, configuring deployment sources, and adding Worker tiers and SKUs.
>
> As of the third technical preview, to create web, API, and Azure Functions apps, you must use the user portal and have a tenant subscription.

1. In the Azure Stack Hub user portal, select **+ Create a resource** > **Web + Mobile** > **Web App**.

1. On the **Web App** blade, type a name in the **Web app** box.

1. Under **Resource Group**, select **New**. Type a name in the **Resource Group** box.

1. Select **App Service plan/Location** > **Create New**.

1. On the **App Service plan** blade, type a name in the **App Service plan** box.

1. Select **Pricing tier** > **Free-Shared** or **Shared-Shared** > **Select** > **OK** > **Create**.

1. In less than a minute, a tile for the new web app appears on the dashboard. Select the tile.

1. On the **Web App** blade, select **Browse** to view the default website for this app.

## Deploy a WordPress, DNN, or Django website (optional)

1. In the Azure Stack Hub user portal, select **+**, go to Azure Marketplace, deploy a Django website, and wait for successful completion. The Django web platform uses a file system-based database. It doesn't require any additional resource providers, such as SQL or MySQL.

1. If you also deployed a MySQL resource provider, you can deploy a WordPress website from Azure Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, enter the user name as *User1\@Server1*, with the user name and server name of your choice.

1. If you also deployed a SQL Server resource provider, you can deploy a DNN website from Azure Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, choose a database on the computer running SQL Server that's connected to your resource provider.
