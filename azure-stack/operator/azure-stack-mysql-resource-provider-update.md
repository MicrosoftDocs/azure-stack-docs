# Update the MySQL resource provider in Azure Stack Hub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before upgrading the resource provider, review the latest release notes to learn about new functionality, fixes, and any known issues that could affect your deployment. The release notes also specify the minimum Azure Stack Hub version required for the update.

A new MySQL resource provider adapter might be released when Azure Stack Hub builds are updated. While the existing adapter continues to work, we recommend updating to the latest build as soon as possible.

Starting with the MySQL resource provider version 1.1.33.0 release, updates are cumulative and don't need to be installed in the order in which they were released as long as you're starting from version 1.1.24.0 or later. For example, if you're running version 1.1.24.0 of the MySQL resource provider, then you can upgrade to version 1.1.33.0 or later without needing to first install version 1.1.30.0. To review available resource provider versions, and the version of Azure Stack Hub they're supported on, refer to the versions list in [Deploy the resource provider prerequisites](./azure-stack-mysql-resource-provider-deploy.md#prerequisites).

To update of the resource provider, you use the **UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1** script. The process is similar to the process used to install a resource provider, as described in the Deploy the resource provider section of this article. The script is included with the download of the resource provider. 

## Update script processes

The **UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1** script creates a new virtual machine (VM) with the latest resource provider code and migrates the settings from the old VM to the new VM. The settings that migrate include database and hosting server information and the necessary DNS record.

>[!NOTE]
>We recommend that you download the latest Windows Server 2016 Core image from Marketplace Management. If you need to install an update, you can place a **single** MSU package in the local dependency path. The script will fail if there's more than one MSU file in this location.

The script requires use of the same arguments that are described for the DeployMySqlProvider.ps1 script. Provide the certificate here as well.  


## Update script parameters 
Specify the following parameters from the command line when you run the **UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1** PowerShell script. If you don't, or if any parameter validation fails, you're prompted to provide the required parameters.

| Parameter Name | Description | Comment or default value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| **CloudAdminCredential** | The credential for the cloud admin, necessary for accessing the privileged endpoint. | _Required_ | 
| **AzCredential** | The credentials for the Azure Stack Hub service admin account. Use the same credentials as you used for deploying Azure Stack Hub. | _Required_ | 
| **VMLocalCredential** |The credentials for the local admin account of the SQL resource provider VM. | _Required_ | 
| **PrivilegedEndpoint** | The IP address or DNS name of the privileged endpoint. |  _Required_ | 
| **AzureEnvironment** | The Azure environment of the service admin account used for deploying Azure Stack Hub. Required only for Azure AD deployments. Supported environment names are **AzureCloud**, **AzureUSGovernment**, or if using a China Azure AD, **AzureChinaCloud**. | AzureCloud |
| **DependencyFilesLocalPath** | Your certificate .pfx file must be placed in this directory as well. | _Optional_ (_mandatory_ for multi-node) | 
| **DefaultSSLCertificatePassword** | The password for the .pfx certificate. | _Required_ | 
| **MaxRetryCount** | The number of times you want to retry each operation if there's a failure.| 2 | 
| **RetryDuration** | The timeout interval between retries, in seconds. | 120 | 
| **Uninstall** | Remove the resource provider and all associated resources (see the following notes). | No | 
| **DebugMode** | Prevents automatic cleanup on failure. | No | 
| **AcceptLicense** | Skips the prompt to accept the GPL license.  (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) | | 

## Update script example

> [!NOTE] 
> The update process only applies to integrated systems.

If you are updating the MySQL resource provider version to 1.1.33.0 or previous versions, you need to install specific versions of AzureRm.BootStrapper and Azure Stack Hub modules in PowerShell. If you are updating the MySQL resource provider to version 1.1.47.0, the deployment script will automatically download and install the necessary PowerShell modules for you to path C:\Program Files\SqlMySqlPsh.

```powershell 
# Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module, set the profile and install the AzureStack module
# Note that this might not be the most currently available version of Azure Stack Hub PowerShell.
Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper -Force
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2018-03-01-hybrid -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.6.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> In disconnected scenario, you need to download the required PowerShell modules and register the repository manually as a prerequisite. You can get more information in [Deploy MySQL resource provider](azure-stack-mysql-resource-provider-deploy.md)

The following example shows the *UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1* script that you can run from an elevated PowerShell console. Be sure to change the variable information and passwords as needed:

```powershell 
# Use the NetBIOS name for the Azure Stack Hub domain. On the Azure Stack Hub SDK, the default is AzureStack but could have been changed at install time.
$domain = "AzureStack" 

# For integrated systems, use the IP address of one of the ERCS VMs.
$privilegedEndpoint = "AzS-ERCS01" 

# Provide the Azure environment used for deploying Azure Stack Hub. Required only for Azure AD deployments. Supported environment names are AzureCloud, AzureUSGovernment, or AzureChinaCloud. 
$AzureEnvironment = "<EnvironmentName>"

# Point to the directory where the resource provider installation files were extracted. 
$tempDir = 'C:\TEMP\MYSQLRP' 

# The service admin account (can be Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services).
$serviceAdmin = "admin@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com" 
$AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$AdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($serviceAdmin, $AdminPass) 
 
# Set credentials for the new resource provider VM.
$vmLocalAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$vmLocalAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("mysqlrpadmin", $vmLocalAdminPass) 
 
# And the cloudadmin credential required for privileged endpoint access.
$CloudAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$CloudAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("$domain\cloudadmin", $CloudAdminPass) 

# Change the following as appropriate.
$PfxPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 

# For version 1.1.47.0, the PowerShell modules used by the RP deployment are placed in C:\Program Files\SqlMySqlPsh
# The deployment script adds this path to the system $env:PSModulePath to ensure correct modules are used.
$rpModulePath = Join-Path -Path $env:ProgramFiles -ChildPath 'SqlMySqlPsh'
$env:PSModulePath = $env:PSModulePath + ";" + $rpModulePath 

# Change directory to the folder where you extracted the installation files.
# Then adjust the endpoints.
.$tempDir\UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1 -AzCredential $AdminCreds ` 
-VMLocalCredential $vmLocalAdminCreds ` 
-CloudAdminCredential $cloudAdminCreds ` 
-PrivilegedEndpoint $privilegedEndpoint ` 
-AzureEnvironment $AzureEnvironment `
-DefaultSSLCertificatePassword $PfxPass ` 
-DependencyFilesLocalPath $tempDir\cert ` 
-AcceptLicense 
```  

When the resource provider update script finishes, close the current PowerShell session.
