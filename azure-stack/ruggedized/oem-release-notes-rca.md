This scenario may be encountered during system boot, where self-heal is attempted. The root cause is a race condition where during the self-heal process, a refresh cycle may not have completed when the CPU issues self-heal related commands to the DRAM.<br/>The Issue is described in Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Specification Update, SKX120 and second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX51.<br/>- Fixed an issue where an invalid location was specified for a self-heal request. This results in self-heal not being performed, which could potentially not respond or reboot the system during POST when "Configuring Memory..." is displayed on the screen. Note: The Dell PowerEdge BIOS will automatically schedule DIMM self-healing during POST, based on DIMM health monitoring of correctable and uncorrectable errors from previous system boots.<br/>- Updated Intel processor microcode to address the following issues:<br/>1. High Levels of Posted Interrupt Traffic on The PCIe Port May Result in a Machine Check with a TOR Timeout. The Issue is described in the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Specification Update, SKX123 and Second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX52.<br/>2. Some Short Loops of Instructions May Cause a 3-Strike Machine Check without a TOR Timeout. The Issue is described in the Second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX53.<br/><br/>Enhancements:<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x3005 for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x6A09 for the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.  |
| 2102  | 2.10.0  | - Increased the 64bit Memory Mapped I/O allocation size, used for PCIe resource management, from 64GB to 256GB per root port to support Nvidia A100 GPU and other PCIe cards that request > 64GB of 64bit PCIe memory.<br/>- Updated the "Processor and Memory Reference Code" for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family to IPU 2020.2.<br/>- Removed the Logical Processor requirement for Monitor/MWait.  |

| 2112  | 2.12.2  | Fixes:<br/>- Incorrect critical error pop-up message that was seen while exiting iDRAC Settings menu.<br/>- Fixed BIOS only report partial data in iDRAC/LC for system/setup password after set by SCP from iDRAC.<br/>- Fix HTTP boot failure with single DNS entry in static IPv4 address mode.<br/><br/>Enhancements:<br/>- Support for Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Operating System.<br/>- Updated the S140 Software RAID firmware to version 5.6.0-0002.<br/>- Updated the "Processor and Memory Reference Code" for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family to IPU 2021.1.<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x3102 for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x6B06 for the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.<br/>- Updated the Purley Refresh PV Candidate Reference Code Version 612D02.<br/>- Updated the AEP Release 1.0.0.3515 files to Purley Refresh UEFI Source.<br/>- Updated SPS to SPS_E5_04.01.04.505.0 (IPU 2021.1) for Purley Refresh.<br/>- Enhancement to address the security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVE) such as CVE-2021-21555, CVE-2021-21556, CVE-2021-21557, CVE-2020-24511, CVE-2020-12358, CVE-2020-12360, CVE-2020-24486, CVE-2019-14553, CVE-2021-21571.  |
| 2108  | 2.10.2  | Fixes:<br/>- Fixed an Intel errata reported on IPU 2020.1 and 2020.2 where the system could potentially not respond or reboot during POST when "Configuring Memory..." is displayed on the screen. This scenario may be encountered during system boot, where self-heal is attempted. The root cause is a race condition where during the self-heal process, a refresh cycle may not have completed when the CPU issues self-heal related commands to the DRAM.<br/>The Issue is described in Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Specification Update, SKX120 and second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX51.<br/>- Fixed an issue where an invalid location was specified for a self-heal request. This results in self-heal not being performed, which could potentially not respond or reboot the system during POST when "Configuring Memory..." is displayed on the screen. Note: The Dell PowerEdge BIOS will automatically schedule DIMM self-healing during POST, based on DIMM health monitoring of correctable and uncorrectable errors from previous system boots.<br/>- Updated Intel processor microcode to address the following issues:<br/>1. High Levels of Posted Interrupt Traffic on The PCIe Port May Result in a Machine Check with a TOR Timeout. The Issue is described in the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family Specification Update, SKX123 and Second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX52.<br/>2. Some Short Loops of Instructions May Cause a 3-Strike Machine Check without a TOR Timeout. The Issue is described in the Second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors Specification Update, CLX53.<br/><br/>Enhancements:<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x3005 for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.<br/>- Updated the Processor Microcode to version 0x6A09 for the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family.  |
| 2102  | 2.10.0  | - Increased the 64bit Memory Mapped I/O allocation size, used for PCIe resource management, from 64GB to 256GB per root port to support Nvidia A100 GPU and other PCIe cards that request > 64GB of 64bit PCIe memory.<br/>- Updated the "Processor and Memory Reference Code" for the second-generation Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family to IPU 2020.2.<br/>- Removed the Logical Processor requirement for Monitor/MWait.  |
