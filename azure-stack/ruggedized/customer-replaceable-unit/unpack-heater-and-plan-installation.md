# Unpack the Heater and Plan the Heater Installation

Read the following sections before you replace the Heater.

## Unpacking and taking inventory of the heater

The Ruggedized 1U Heater -- V2 (the heater) typically ships as a
pre-installed sub-component of the Ruggedized Cloud Appliance system.
When shipped separately, the heater is shipped in a standard
commercial shipping carton with protective packing material.

Carefully remove the heater from the shipping carton. When packed in a
shipping carton, the heater has all key components installed in the
chassis. The heater is usually part of a transit case and integrated
with an entire group of devices in a transit case. Keep the shipping
carton and packing materials for any possible need to re-ship the
heater in the future. While the heater is robust, ensure that the unit
is properly packed for shipment.

Do an inventory check to ensure that everything is accounted for. For
discrepancies, contact Microsoft.

## Heater installation planning

Before you begin your installation, ensure that you are familiar with
the configuration requirements of the heater unit. Before you begin
the installation:

1.  Prepare the transit case for heater installation.

2.  Verify that you have all necessary screws and washers for the heater
    installation:

    -   Four black screws 10-32 x 7/8 with four split washers and four
        flat washers

    -   Four silver 10-32 x 5/8 screws with four split washers and four
        flat washers

3.  Ensure that cables or cords are not in the way of installation.

## Heater installation notes

The heater is mounted into a transit case capable of holding the unit.

-   Remove the lids of the transit case and any shipping covers while
    the heater is in use.

-   Ensure that there is a minimum gap of six inches in the front and
    rear of the heater to maintain the correct airflow around the unit.

-   Mount the heater into the rack in the transit case.

-   Mount the heater into the 19-inch rack in the transit case. Use two
    or more individuals to manage the weight of the unit during the
    mounting process.

-   Install any other required component such as plenums, cables, or
    brackets.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the socket-outlet is installed near the
equipment and is easily accessible.
