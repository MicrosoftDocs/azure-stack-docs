# Required knowledge for working with scale unit nodes in Azure Stack Hub ruggedized

To complete FRU procedures, you must be familiar with and able to
access the following concepts, guides, and web sites.

## Privileged Access Workstation and the privileged endpoint

The Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) is a dedicated workstation
protected from the Internet and external threat vectors. It can reside
on the Hardware Lifecycle Host (HLH) or externally on the customer
network with routable access to the Azure Stack Hub Scale Unit nodes.

To access the PAW, you must log in using Remote Desktop. Obtain the
credentials and IP address from the customer.

From this machine, you can also access the privileged endpoint (PEP).

## Azure Stack Hub Administrator Portal

Obtain the Administrator Portal credentials and URL from the customer.
For more information, see [Use the administrator
portal](../../operator/azure-stack-manage-portals.md)
[in Azure Stack
Hub](../../operator/azure-stack-manage-portals.md).
