# Analyze Azure Stack usage with local usage meters

Information about which subscriptions use which resources is stored in a local usage database. Administrators can retrieve this data to analyze which users are consuming resources.

## API call reference

### Request

The request gets consumption details for the requested subscriptions and for the requested time frame. There's no request body.

This usage API is a provider API, so the caller must be assigned an **Owner**, **Contributor**, or **Reader** role in the provider's subscription.

| Method | Request URI |
| --- | --- |
| GET |`https://{armendpoint}/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Commerce.Admin/subscriberUsageAggregates?reportedStartTime={reportedStartTime}&reportedEndTime={reportedEndTime}&aggregationGranularity={granularity}&subscriberId={sub1.1}&api-version=2015-06-01-preview&continuationToken={token-value}` |

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `armendpoint` |Azure Resource Manager endpoint of your Azure Stack environment. The Azure Stack convention is that the name of the Azure Resource Manager endpoint is in the format `https://adminmanagement.{domain-name}`. <!-- TZLASDKFIX For example, for the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK), if the domain name is *local.azurestack.external*, then the Resource Manager endpoint is `https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external`. --> |
| `subId` |Subscription ID of the user who makes the call. |
| `reportedStartTime` |Start time of the query. The value for `DateTime` should be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and at the beginning of the hour; for example, 13:00. For daily aggregation, set this value to UTC midnight. The format is escaped ISO 8601; for example, `2015-06-16T18%3a53%3a11%2b00%3a00Z`, where the colon is escaped to `%3a` and the plus is escaped to `%2b` so that it's URI-friendly. |
| `reportedEndTime` |End time of the query. The constraints that apply to `reportedStartTime` also apply to this argument. The value for `reportedEndTime` can't be either in the future, or the current date. If it is, the result is set to "processing not complete." |
| `aggregationGranularity` |Optional parameter that has two discrete potential values: **daily** and **hourly**. As the values suggest, one returns the data in daily granularity, and the other is an hourly resolution. The **daily** option is the default. |
| `subscriberId` |Subscription ID. To get filtered data, the subscription ID of a direct tenant of the provider is required. If no subscription ID parameter is specified, the call returns usage data for all the provider's direct tenants. |
| `api-version` |Version of the protocol that's used to make this request. This value is set to `2015-06-01-preview`. |
| `continuationToken` |Token retrieved from the last call to the usage API provider. This token is needed when a response is greater than 1,000 lines. It acts as a bookmark for the progress. If the token isn't present, the data is retrieved from the beginning of the day or hour, based on the granularity passed in. |

### Response

```http
GET
/subscriptions/sub1/providers/Microsoft.Commerce.Admin/subscriberUsageAggregates?reportedStartTime=reportedStartTime=2014-05-01T00%3a00%3a00%2b00%3a00&reportedEndTime=2015-06-01T00%3a00%3a00%2b00%3a00&aggregationGranularity=Daily&subscriberId=sub1.1&api-version=1.0
```

"quantity":2.4000000000,
"meterId":"meterID1"

}
},

. . .
```

### Response details

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`id` |Unique ID of the usage aggregate. |
|`name` |Name of the usage aggregate. |
|`type` |Resource definition. |
|`subscriptionId` |Subscription identifier of the Azure Stack user. |
|`usageStartTime`|UTC start time of the usage bucket to which this usage aggregate belongs.|
|`usageEndTime`|UTC end time of the usage bucket to which this usage aggregate belongs. |
|`instanceData` |Key-value pairs of instance details (in a new format):<br> `resourceUri`: Fully qualified resource ID, which includes the resource groups and the instance name. <br> `location`: Region in which this service was run. <br> `tags`: Resource tags that are specified by the user. <br> `additionalInfo`: More details about the resource that was consumed; for example, the OS version or image type. |
|`quantity`|Amount of resource consumption that occurred in this time frame. |
|`meterId` |Unique ID for the resource that was consumed (also called `ResourceID`). |

## Retrieve usage information

### PowerShell

To generate the usage data, you should have resources that are running and actively using the system; for example, an active virtual machine (VM), or a storage account containing some data. If you're not sure whether you have any resources running in the Azure Stack marketplace, deploy a VM, and verify the VM monitoring blade to make sure it's running. Use the following PowerShell cmdlets to view the usage data:

1. [Install PowerShell for Azure Stack](../../operator/azure-stack-powershell-install.md).
2. [Configure the Azure Stack user](../../user/azure-stack-powershell-configure-user.md) or the [Azure Stack operator](../../operator/azure-stack-powershell-configure-admin.md) PowerShell environment.
3. To retrieve the usage data, call the [Get-AzsSubscriberUsage](/powershell/module/azs.commerce.admin/get-azssubscriberusage) PowerShell cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzsSubscriberUsage -ReportedStartTime "2017-09-06T00:00:00Z" -ReportedEndTime "2017-09-07T00:00:00Z"
   ```

### REST API

You can collect usage information for deleted subscriptions by calling the  Microsoft.Commerce.Admin service.

#### Return all tenant usage for deleted for active users

| Method | Request URI |
| --- | --- |
| GET | `https://{armendpoint}/subscriptions/{subId}/providersMicrosoft.Commerce.Admin/subscriberUsageAggregates?reportedStartTime={start-time}&reportedEndTime={end-endtime}&aggregationGranularity=Hourly&api-version=2015-06-01-preview` |

#### Return usage for deleted or active tenant

| Method | Request URI |
| --- | --- |
| GET |`https://{armendpoint}/subscriptions/{subId}/providersMicrosoft.Commerce.Admin/subscriberUsageAggregates?reportedStartTime={start-time}&reportedEndTime={end-endtime}&aggregationGranularity=Hourly&subscriberId={subscriber-id}&api-version=2015-06-01-preview` |
