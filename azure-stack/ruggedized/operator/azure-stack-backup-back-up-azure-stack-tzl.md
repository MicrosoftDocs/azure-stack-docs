# Back up Azure Stack - Azure Stack Hub Ruggedized

*Applies to: Modular Data Center, Azure Stack Hub ruggedized*

This article shows you how to do an on-demand backup of Azure Stack.

## Start backup

Backups are automatically scheduled. Starting an on-demand backup is only necessary if you receive an alert to trigger backup manually. To start on-demand backup, select **Backup now**. An on-demand backup won't modify the time for the next scheduled backup. After the task completes, you can confirm the settings in the **Essentials blade**:

## Start Azure Stack backup

You can also run the PowerShell cmdlet **Start-AzsBackup** on your Azure Stack admin computer.

### Start a new backup without job progress tracking

Use **Start-AzSBackup** to start a new backup immediately with no job progress tracking.

```powershell
Start-AzsBackup -Force
```

## Start Azure Stack backup with job progress tracking

Use **Start-AzSBackup** to start a new backup with the **-AsJob** parameter and save it as a variable to track backup job progress.

> [!NOTE]
> Your backup job appears as successfully completed in the portal about 10-15 minutes before the job finishes.
>
> The actual status is better observed via the following code.

The initial 1 millisecond delay is introduced because the code is too quick to register the job correctly. The code reports no **PSBeginTime** and in turn, no **State** of the job.

```powershell
$BackupJob = Start-AzsBackup -Force -AsJob
While (!$BackupJob.PSBeginTime) {
    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1
}
Write-Host "Start time: $($BackupJob.PSBeginTime)"
While ($BackupJob.State -eq "Running") {
    Write-Host "Job is currently: $($BackupJob.State) - Duration: $((New-TimeSpan -Start ($BackupJob.PSBeginTime) -End (Get-Date)).ToString().Split(".")[0])"
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
}

If ($BackupJob.State -eq "Completed") {
    Get-AzsBackup | Where-Object {$_.BackupId -eq $BackupJob.Output.BackupId}
    $Duration = $BackupJob.Output.TimeTakenToCreate
    $Pattern = '^P?T?((?<Years>\d+)Y)?((?<Mohs>\d+)M)?((?<Weeks>\d+)W)?((?<Days>\d+)D)?(T((?<Hours>\d+)H)?((?<Minutes>\d+)M)?((?<Seconds>\d*(\.)?\d*)S)?)$'
    If ($Duration -match $Pattern) {
        If (!$Matches.ContainsKey("Hours")) {
            $Hours = ""
        } 
        Else {
            $Hours = ($Matches.Hours).ToString + 'h '
        }
        $Minutes = ($Matches.Minutes)
        $Seconds = [math]::round(($Matches.Seconds))
        $Runtime = '{0}{1:00}m {2:00}s' -f $Hours, $Minutes, $Seconds
    }
    Write-Host "BackupJob: $($BackupJob.Output.BackupId) - Completed with Status: $($BackupJob.Output.Status) - It took: $($Runtime) to run" -ForegroundColor Green
}
ElseIf ($BackupJob.State -ne "Completed") {
    $BackupJob
    $BackupJob.Output
}
```

## Confirm backup has completed

### Confirm backup has completed using PowerShell

Use the following PowerShell commands to ensure the backup has completed successfully:

```powershell
Get-AzsBackup
```

The result should look like the following output:

```shell
BackupDataVersion : 1.0.1
BackupId          : <backup ID>
RoleStatus        : {NRP, SRP, CRP, KeyVaultInternalControlPlane...}
Status            : Succeeded
CreatedDateTime   : 7/6/2018 6:46:24 AM
TimeTakenToCreate : PT20M32.364138S
DeploymentID      : <deployment ID>
StampVersion      : 1.1807.0.41
OemVersion        : 
Id                : /subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/System.local/providers/Microsoft.Backup.Admin/backupLocations/local/backups/<backup ID>
Name              : local/<local name>
Type              : Microsoft.Backup.Admin/backupLocations/backups
Location          : local
Tags              : {}
```

### Confirm backup has completed in the administrator portal

Use the Azure Stack administrator portal to verify that backup has completed successfully by following these steps:

1. Open the [Azure Stack administrator portal](../../operator/azure-stack-manage-portals.md).

2. Select **All services**, and then under the **Administration** category select **Infrastructure backup**. Choose **Configuration** in the **Infrastructure backup** blade.

3. Find the **Name** and **Date Completed** of the backup in **Available backups** list.

4. Verify the **State** is **Succeeded**.
