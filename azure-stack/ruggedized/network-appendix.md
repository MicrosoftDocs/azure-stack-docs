## Identity

All network devices are designed to work with Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS). TACACS provides a centralized identity experience. The TACACS server must be supplied as part of the initial configuration.

Notice once the TACACS server isn't available, the devices will fall back to the local identities listed below. During normal operation, those accounts are disabled.

The following user accounts do exit per device:

| Device | Username | Default password     |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Tor 1  | Root     | Assigned by customer |
| Tor 2  | Root     | Assigned by customer |
| BMC    | Root     | Assigned by customer |
