# Azure Stack Hub ruggedized network deployment

This topic covers access permission to the TOR switches, IP address assignments and other networking deployment tasks. 

## Plan configuration deployment

The next sections cover permissions and IP address assignments.

### Physical switch access control list

To protect the Azure Stack solution, we have implemented access control lists (ACLs) on the TOR switches. 
This section describes how this security is implemented. 
The table below shows the sources and destinations of every network inside the Azure Stack solution:

The table below correlates the ACL references with the Azure Stack networks.

| BMC Mgmt                                   | Deployment VM, BMC Interface, HLH server NTP Server and DNS server IPs included as Permit based on the protocol and port. |

### IP address assignments

In the Deployment Worksheet, you are asked to provide the following network
addresses to support the Azure Stack deployment process. The deployment team
uses the Deployment Worksheet tool to break out the IP networks into all the
smaller networks required by the system. Please refer to the "NETWORK DESIGN AND
INFRASTRUCTURE" section above for detailed descriptions of each network.

In this example, we will fill the Network Settings tab of the Deployment
Worksheet with the following values:

-   BMC Network: 10.193.132.0 /27

-   Private Network Storage Network & Internal VIPs: 11.11.128.0 /24

-   Infrastructure Network: 12.193.130.0 /24

-   Public Virtual IP (VIP) Network: 13.200.132.0 /24

-   Switch Infrastructure Network: 10.193.132.128 /26

When you run the Generate function of the Deployment Worksheet tool, it creates
two new tabs on the spreadsheet. The first tab is the Subnet Summary and it
shows how the supernets were split to create all the networks required by the
system. In our example below there is only a subset of the columns found on this
tab. The actual result has more details of each network listed:

| **Rack** | **Subnet Type** | **Name**                                   | **IPv4 Subnet**   | **IPv4 Addresses** |

The second tab is **IP Address Usage** and it shows how the IPs are consumed:

#### BMC network

The supernet for the BMC network requires a /26 network at a minimum. The
gateway uses the first IP in the network followed by the BMC devices in the
rack. The hardware lifecycle host has multiple addresses assigned on this
network and can be used to deploy, monitor, and support the rack. These IPs are
distributed into 3 groups: DVM, InternalAccessible and ExternalAccessible.

- Rack: Rack1        
- Name: BMCMgmt      

| **Assigned To**      | **IPv4 Address** |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Network              | 10.193.132.0     |
| Gateway              | 10.193.132.1     |
| HLH-BMC              | 10.193.132.2     |
| AzS-Node01           | 10.193.132.3     |
| AzS-Node02           | 10.193.132.4     |
| AzS-Node03           | 10.193.132.5     |
| AzS-Node04           | 10.193.132.6     |
| ExternalAccessible-1 | 10.193.132.19    |
| ExternalAccessible-2 | 10.193.132.20    |
| ExternalAccessible-3 | 10.193.132.21    |
| ExternalAccessible-4 | 10.193.132.22    |
| ExternalAccessible-5 | 10.193.132.23    |
| InternalAccessible-1 | 10.193.132.24    |
| InternalAccessible-2 | 10.193.132.25    |
| InternalAccessible-3 | 10.193.132.26    |
| InternalAccessible-4 | 10.193.132.27    |
| InternalAccessible-5 | 10.193.132.28    |
| CL01-RG01-SU01-DVM00 | 10.193.132.29    |
| HLH-OS               | 10.193.132.30    |
| Broadcast            | 10.193.132.31    |

#### Storage network

The Storage network is a private network and isn’t intended to be routed beyond
the rack. It’s the first half of the Private Network supernet and it’s used by
the switch distributed as shown on the table below. The gateway is the first IP
in the subnet. The second half used for the Internal VIPs is a private pool of
addresses that is managed by Azure Stack SLB, is not shown on the IP Address
Usage tab. These networks support Azure Stack and there are ACLs on the TOR
switches that prevent these networks from been advertised and/or accessed
outside the solution.

- Rack: Rack1               
- Name: CL01-RG01-SU01-Storage 

| **Assigned To**              | **IPv4 Address** |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| Network                      | 11.11.128.0      |
| Gateway                      | 11.11.128.1      |
| TOR1                         | 11.11.128.2      |
| TOR2                         | 11.11.128.3      |
| Broadcast                    | 11.11.128.127    |

#### Azure Stack infrastructure network

The infrastructure network supernet requires a /24 network and this continues to
be a /24 after the Deployment Worksheet tool runs. The gateway will be the first
IP in the subnet.

- Rack: Rack1 
- Name: CL01-RG01-SU01-Infra 

| **Assigned To**            | **IPv4 Address** |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Network                    | 12.193.130.0     |
| Gateway                    | 12.193.130.1     |
| TOR1                       | 12.193.130.2     |
| TOR2                       | 12.193.130.3     |
| Broadcast                  | 12.193.130.255   |

#### Switch infrastructure network

The infrastructure network is broken into multiple networks used by the physical switch
infrastructure. This is different from the Azure Stack Infrastructure which only
supports the Azure Stack software. The Switch Infra Network supports only the
physical switch infrastructure. The networks that are supported by infra are:

| **Name**                                   | **IPv4 Subnet**   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| P2P_Border/Border1_To_Rack1/TOR1           | 10.193.132.128/30 |
| P2P_Border/Border1_To_Rack1/TOR2           | 10.193.132.132/30 |
| P2P_Border/Border2_To_Rack1/TOR1           | 10.193.132.136/30 |
| P2P_Border/Border2_To_Rack1/TOR2           | 10.193.132.140/30 |
| P2P_Rack1/TOR1_To_Rack1/BMC                | 10.193.132.144/30 |
| P2P_Rack1/TOR2_To_Rack1/BMC                | 10.193.132.148/30 |
| Loopback0_Rack1_TOR1                       | 10.193.132.152/32 |
| Loopback0_Rack1_TOR2                       | 10.193.132.153/32 |
| Loopback0_Rack1_BMC                        | 10.193.132.154/32 |
| P2P_Rack1/TOR1-ibgp-1_To_Rack1/TOR2-ibgp-1 | 10.193.132.156/30 |
| P2P_Rack1/TOR1-ibgp-2_To_Rack1/TOR2-ibgp-2 | 10.193.132.160/30 |
| SwitchMgmt                                 | 10.193.132.168/29 |
|                                            |                   |

-   Point-to-point (P2P): These networks allow connectivity between all
    switches. The subnet size is a /30 network for each P2P. The lowest IP is
    always assigned to the upstream (North) device on the stack.

-   Loopback: These addresses are /32 networks that are assigned to each switch
    used in the rack. The border devices are not assigned a loopback since they
    aren’t expected to be part of the Azure Stack solution.

-   Switch Mgmt or Switch Management: This /29 network supports the dedicated
    management interfaces of the switches in the rack. The IPs are assigned as
    follows; this table can also be found on the IP Address Usage tab of the
    Deployment Worksheet:

- Rack: Rack1    
- Name: SwitchMgmt 

| **Assigned To**  | **IPv4 Address** |
|------------------|------------------|
| Network          | 10.193.132.168   |
| Gateway          | 10.193.132.169   |
| TOR1             | 10.193.132.170   |
| TOR2             | 10.193.132.171   |
| Broadcast        | 10.193.132.175   |

## Prepare environment

The hardware lifecycle host image does contain the required Linux container that
is used to generate the physical network switch configuration.

The latest partner deployment toolkit does include the latest container image.
The container image on the hardware lifecycle host can be replaced when it is
necessary to generate an updated switch configuration.

Here are the steps to update the container image:

1.  Download the container image

2.  Replace the container image at the following location

## Generate configuration

Here we will walk you through the steps of generating the JSON files and the
Network Switch Configuration files:

1.  Open the Deployment Worksheet

2.  Fill all the required fields on all tabs

3.  Invoke the "Generate" function on the Deployment Worksheet.  
    Two extra tabs will be created displaying the generated IP subnets and
    assignments.

4.  Review the data and once confirmed, invoke the "Export" function.  
    You will be prompted to provide a folder in which the JSON files will be
    saved.

5.  Execute the container using the Invoke-SwitchConfigGenerator.ps1. This
    script requires an elevated PowerShell console to execute and requires the
    following parameters to execute.

    -   ContainerName – Name of the container that will generate the switch
        configs.

    -   ConfigurationData – Path to the ConfigurationData.json file exported
        from the Deployment Worksheet.

    -   OutputDirectory – Path to the output directory.

    -   Offline – Signals that the script runs in offline mode.

    ```powershell
    C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\> .\\Invoke-SwitchConfigGenerate.ps1 -ContainerName generalonrampacr.azurecr.io/master -ConfigurationData .\\ConfigurationData.json -OutputDirectory c:\\temp -Offline
    ```

### Custom configuration

You can modify a few environmental settings for your Azure Stack switch
configuration. You can identify which of the settings you can change in the
template. This article explains each of those customizable settings, and how the
changes can affect your Azure Stack. These settings include password update,
syslog server, SNMP monitoring, authentication, and the access control list.

During deployment of the Azure Stack solution, the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) creates and applies the switch configuration for both TORs
and BMC. The OEM uses the Azure Stack automation tool to validate that the
required configurations are properly set on these devices. The configuration is
based the information in your Azure Stack Deployment Worksheet. 

>[!NOTE]
>**Do not** alter the configuration without consent from either the OEM or the Microsoft Azure Stack engineering team. A change to the network device configuration can significantly impact the operation or troubleshooting of network issues in your Azure Stack instance. For more information about these functions on your network device, how to make these changes, please contact your OEM hardware provider or Microsoft support. Your OEM has the configuration file created by the automation tool based on your Azure Stack deployment worksheet. 

However, there are some values that can be added, removed, or changed on the
configuration of the network switches.

#### Password update

The operator may update the password for any user on the network switches at any
time. There isn't a requirement to change any information on the Azure Stack
system, or to use the steps for Rotate secrets in Azure Stack.

#### Syslog server

Operators can redirect the switch logs to a syslog server on their datacenter.
Use this configuration to ensure that the logs from a particular point in time
can be used for troubleshooting. By default, the logs are stored on the
switches; their capacity for storing logs is limited. Check the Access control
list updates section for an overview of how to configure the permissions for
switch management access.

#### SNMP monitoring

The operator can configure simple network management protocol (SNMP) v2 or v3 to
monitor the network devices and send traps to a network monitoring application
on the datacenter. For security reasons, use SNMPv3 since it is more secure than
v2. Consult your OEM hardware provider for the MIBs and configuration required.
Check the Access control list updates section for an overview of how to
configure the permissions for switch management access.

#### Authentication

The operator can configure either RADIUS or TACACS to manage authentication on
the network devices. Consult your OEM hardware provider for supported methods
and configuration required. Check the Access control list updates section for an
overview of how to configure the permissions for Switch Management access.

#### Access control list updates

The operator can change some access control list (ACL)s to allow access to
network device management interfaces and the hardware lifecycle host (HLH) from
a trusted datacenter network range. The operator can pick which component will
be reachable and from where. With the access control list, The operator can
allow their management jumpbox VMs within a specific network range to access the
switch management interface, and the HLH OS, and the HLH BMC.

For further details see [Physical switch access control list](#physical-switch-access-control-list).

#### TACACS, RADIUS and Syslog

The Azure Stack solution will not be shipped with a TACACS or RADIUS solution
for access control of devices like the switches and routers, nor a Syslog
solution to capture switch logs, but all these devices support those services.
To help integrate with an existing TACACS, RADIUS and/or Syslog server on your
environment, we will provide an extra file with the Network Switch Configuration
which will allow the engineer onsite to customize the switch to the customer’s
needs.
