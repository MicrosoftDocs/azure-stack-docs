# Validate software updates from Microsoft

[!INCLUDE [Azure_Stack_Partner](./includes/azure-stack-partner-appliesto.md)]

Microsoft will periodically release updates to the Azure Stack software. These updates are provided to Azure Stack co-engineering partners. The updates are provided in advance of publicly available. You can check the updates against your solution and provide feedback to Microsoft.

Microsoft software updates to Azure Stack are designated using a naming convention, for example, 1803 indicating the update is for March 2018. For information about the Azure Stack update policy, cadence and release notes are available, see [Azure Stack servicing policy](../operator/azure-stack-servicing-policy.md).
