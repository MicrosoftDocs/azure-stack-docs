- Cloud Simulation Engine in the OEM Package Validation workflow and the Azure Stack Hub Update workflow  (Version 5.1.30.0 -> 5.1.46.0) require that the tests be scheduled in the following order – Monthly Azure Stack Hub Update Verification test, OEM Extension Package Verification test, and finally Cloud Simulation Engine.
- VaaS Agent Update: The updated VaaS Agent now uses the Azure Stack Hub Cloud Admin credentials to query the stamp to get the stamp information in order to autopopulate the workflows.

  This update requires all of the agents to be updated and restarted. See these instructions on [how to update the VaaS Agent](/azure-stack/partner/azure-stack-vaas-local-agent).

3. Cancel the test.
4. Send the saved output to VaaSHelp@microsoft.com to receive passing results for the run.

- Internal bug fixes.

## Version 4.0.1

2018 October 8

- VaaS prerequisites:

    `Install-VaaSPrerequisites` no longer requires cloud admin credentials. If you're running the latest version of this cmdlet, see [Download and install the local agent](azure-stack-vaas-local-agent.md#download-and-install-the-local-agent) for the revised commands for installing prerequisites. Here are the commands:

    ```powershell
    $ServiceAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential "<aadServiceAdminUser>", (ConvertTo-SecureString "<aadServiceAdminPassword>" -AsPlainText -Force)
    Import-Module .\VaaSPreReqs.psm1 -Force
    Install-VaaSPrerequisites -AadTenantId $AadTenantId `
                              -ServiceAdminCreds $ServiceAdminCreds `
                              -ArmEndpoint https://adminmanagement.$ExternalFqdn `
                              -Region $Region
    ```

## Version 4.0.0

2018 August 29

- VaaS prerequisites and VHD updates:

    `Install-VaaSPrerequisites` now requires cloud admin credentials to address an issue during Package Validation. The documentation at [Download and install the local agent](azure-stack-vaas-local-agent.md#download-and-install-the-local-agent) has been updated with the following code:

    ```powershell
    $ServiceAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential "<aadServiceAdminUser>", (ConvertTo-SecureString "<aadServiceAdminPassword>" -AsPlainText -Force)
    $CloudAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential "<cloudAdminDomain\username>", (ConvertTo-SecureString "<cloudAdminPassword>" -AsPlainText -Force)
    Import-Module .\VaaSPreReqs.psm1 -Force
    Install-VaaSPrerequisites -AadTenantId $AadTenantId `
                              -ServiceAdminCreds $ServiceAdminCreds `
                              -ArmEndpoint https://adminmanagement.$ExternalFqdn `
                              -Region $Region `
                              -CloudAdminCredentials $CloudAdminCreds
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `$CloudAdminCreds` required by the script are for the Azure Stack Hub instance being validated. They're not the Azure Active Directory credentials used by the VaaS tenant.

- Local agent update:

    The previous version of the local agent isn't compatible with the current 4.0.0 release of the service. All users must update their local agents. See [Download and install the local agent](azure-stack-vaas-local-agent.md#download-and-install-the-local-agent) for instructions on installing the newest agent.

- PowerShell automation update:

    Changes were made to `LaunchVaaSTests` PowerShell scripts that require the latest version of the scripting packages. See [Launch the Test Pass workflow](azure-stack-vaas-automate-with-powershell.md) for instructions on installing the latest version of the scripting package.

- Validation as a service portal:

  - Package signing notifications

    When an OEM customization package is submitted as part of the Package Validation workflow, the package format will be validated to ensure it follows the published specification. If the package doesn't comply, the run will fail. Email notifications will be sent to the email address of the registered Azure Active Directory contact for the tenant.

  - Interactive test category:

    The **Interactive** test category has been added. These tests exercise interactive, non-automated Azure Stack Hub scenarios.

  - Interactive Feature Verification:

    The ability to provide focused feedback for certain features is now available in the Test Pass workflow. The `OEM Update on Azure Stack Hub 1806 RC Validation 5.1.4.0` test checks to see if specific updates were correctly applied and then collects feedback.
