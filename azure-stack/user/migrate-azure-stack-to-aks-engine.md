# Migrate workloads to AKS engine from AKS preview on Azure Stack Hub

This article explains how to migrate existing workloads in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) preview on Azure Stack Hub to AKS engine, and summarizes AKS feature differences. The AKS preview is being deprecated in favor of extending support for AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub.

[AKS engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine) provides a command-line tool to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters on Azure and Azure Stack Hub. By using Azure Resource Manager, AKS engine helps you create and maintain clusters running on VMs, virtual networks, and other Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources in Azure Stack Hub. To learn more about AKS engine, see the [AKS engine overview](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview.md), and review the [AKS engine feature comparison](#compare-features-aks-engine-vs-aks-preview) in this article.

## Migrate workloads to AKS engine

You can run AKS and AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub at the same time. To minimize application downtime, deploy and verify workloads on AKS engine before you delete the AKS clusters you created in the AKS preview.

To move workloads to AKS engine, do the following steps:

1. Meet the [prerequisites for AKS engine](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-set-up.md#prerequisites-for-aks-engine).

1. [Deploy a cluster using AKS engine](azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-cluster.md).

1. Deploy your running workloads on the Kubernetes cluster created with AKS engine.

1. Verify that your newly deployed workloads are running successfully on AKS engine.

1. (Optional) [Delete your deployed AKS clusters](aks-how-to-use-cli.md?view=azs-2206&preserve-view=true&tabs=windows%2Clinuxcon#delete-cluster) from the AKS preview after you verify a successful deployment via AKS engine.

## Compare features: AKS engine vs. AKS preview

The following table compares AKS features in global Azure with features in the AKS preview on Azure Stack Hub, which is being deprecated, and AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub.
