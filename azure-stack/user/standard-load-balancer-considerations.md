# Standard Load Balancer considerations in Azure Stack Hub

Azure Stack Hub now supports the Standard Load Balancer SKU. While this new SKU enables customer scenarios, there are certain differences between the Standard Load Balancer SKU on Azure Stack Hub and the Azure Load Balancer available in Azure. This section describes the main differences between the two, and the scenarios we validated in the Standard Load Balancer on Azure Stack Hub.

## Main differences in Standard Load Balancer between Azure and Azure Stack Hub

| Feature                                       | Azure                                                                                                                                                                             | Azure Stack Hub                                                                                        |

## Scenarios

The following scenarios were validated for the Standard Load Balancer on Azure Stack Hub:

- Standard public IP and HTTPS health probes.
- Backend pools with different endpoint types.
- Inbound rules, outbound rules, and endpoint security.
- Multiple backend pools, frontend IPs, outbound rules and timeout configurations.
- Single backend pool with multiple frontend IPs.
- Outbound-only load balancer configuration.
- Internal load balancer with HA ports.
- Internal load balancer with HA ports and floating IP.

> [!NOTE]
> Portal diagnostic features for the Standard Load Balancer are not supported.
