# Rotate Kubernetes certificates using AKS engine on Azure Stack Hub

This document provides guidance on how to rotate certificates on an existing AKS Engine cluster and recommendations for using adopting `aks-engine rotate-certs` as a tool.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This feature is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you already have deployed a cluster using AKS engine and the cluster is in a healthy state.
## Planning for certificate rotation

When considering using this functionality, be aware that the Kubernetes control plane will be unavailable during the update, validation, and restart steps. Plan this maintenance operation accordingly. Also, plan to execute this operation in a staging environment with equal configuration to the production environment before trying in production.

Review the following considerations before attempting this operation:

> [!Note]
> For AKSe version 0.75.3 and above, the commands for certificate rotation begin with `aks-engine-azurestack` rather than `aks-engine`.

-  You will need access to the API model (`apimodel.json`) that was generated by the commands `aks-engine deploy` or `aks-engine generate`. By default this file is placed into a relative directory such as `_output/<clustername>/`.
-  An `aks-engine rotate-certs` operation causes API server downtime.
-  `aks-engine rotate-certs` expects an API model that conforms to the current state of the cluster. `aks-engine rotate-certs` executes remote commands on the cluster nodes and uses the API model information to establish a secure SSH connection. `aks-engine rotate-certs` also relies on some resources to be named in accordance with the original `aks-engine` deployment, for example, VMs must follow the naming provided by `aks-engine`.
-  `aks-engine rotate-certs` relies upon a working connection to the cluster control plane during certificate rotation:
    - To validate each step of the process.
    - To restart/recreate cluster resources such as **kube-system pods** and service account tokens.

    If you are rotating the certificates of a cluster in a VNet closed to outside access, you must run `aks-engine rotate-certs` from a host VM that has network access to the control plane, for example, a jumpbox VM that resides in the same VNet as the master VMs.

- If you are using `aks-engine rotate-certs` in production, it is recommended to stage a certificate rotation test on a cluster that was built to the same specifications. That is, the cluster is built with the same cluster configuration, the same version of the AKS engine command-line tool, and the same set of enabled addons as your production cluster before performing the certificate rotation. AKS engine supports different cluster configurations and the extent of end-to-end testing that the AKS engine team runs cannot practically cover every possible configuration. Therefore, it is recommended that you ensure in a staging environment that your specific cluster configuration works with `aks-engine rotate-certs` before attempting the operation on your production cluster.
-  `aks-engine rotate-certs` does **not** guarantee backwards compatibility. If you deployed with aks-engine version 0.60.x, you should prefer executing the certificate rotation process with version 0.60.x.
-  Fetching a new set of certificates from Key Vault is not supported at this point.
- Use a reliable network connection. `aks-engine rotate-certs` requires the execution of multiple remote commands, which are subject to potential failures, mostly if the connection to the cluster nodes is not reliable. Running `aks-engine rotate-certs` from a VM running on the target Azure Stack stamp can reduce the occurrence of transient issues.

| --resource-group        | yes          | Azure resource group where the cluster infra is deployed.                                                   |
| --client-id             | depends      | The service principal client ID. Required if the auth-method is set to client_secret or client_certificate. |
| --client-secret         | depends      | The service principal client secret. Required if the auth-method is set to client_secret.                   |
| --azure-env             | depends      | The target cloud name. Optional if target cloud is AzureCloud.                                              |

## Simple steps to rotate certificates

For AKS Engine versions 0.75.3 and above, once you have read all the [requirements](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/master/docs/topics/rotate-certs.md#pre-requirements), run `aks-engine-azurestack rotate-certs` with the appropriate arguments (see below).

For AKS Engine versions 0.73.0 and below, once you have read all the [requirements](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/master/docs/topics/rotate-certs.md#pre-requirements), run `aks-engine rotate-certs` with the appropriate arguments:

```bash  
./bin/aks-engine rotate-certs \
  --location <resource-group-location> \
  --api-model <generated-apimodel.json> \
  --linux-ssh-private-key <private-SSH-key> \
  --ssh-host <apiserver-URI> \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --client-id <service-principal-id> \
  --client-secret <service-principal-secret> \
  --subscription-id <subscription-id> \
  --azure-env <cloud-name>
```

For example:

```bash  
./bin/aks-engine rotate-certs \
  --location "westus2" \
  --api-model "_output/my-cluster/apimodel.json" \
  --linux-ssh-private-key "~/.ssh/id_rsa" \
  --ssh-host "my-cluster.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com"\
  --resource-group "my-cluster" \
  --client-id "12345678-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-1234567890ab" \
  --client-secret "12345678-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-1234567890ab" \
  --subscription-id "12345678-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-1234567890ab" \
  --azure-env "AzureStackCloud" # optional if targeting AzureCloud
```

## Rotate `front-proxy` certificates

> [!Note]
> For AKSe version 0.75.3 and above, the commands for certificate rotation begin with `aks-engine-azurestack` rather than `aks-engine`.

The AKS engine creates a separate PKI for  the `front-proxy` as part of node bootstrapping process and delivers them to all nodes through `etcd`. To effectively reuse this functionality, `rotate-certs` has to replace the certificates stored in `etcd`. The `front-proxy` certificates expire after 30 years.` aks-engine rotate-certs` rotates the front-proxy certs.
## Troubleshooting
> [!Note]
> For AKSe version 0.75.3 and above, the commands for certificate rotation begin with `aks-engine-azurestack` rather than `aks-engine`.


If the certificate rotation process halts before completion due to a failure or transient issue, for example, network connectivity, it is safe to rerun `aks-engine rotate-certs` using the `--force` flag.

Also notice that `aks-engine rotate-certs` logs the output of every step in file `/var/log/azure/rotate-certs.log` (Linux) and `c:\\k\\rotate-certs.log` (Windows).

For more information on what happens under the hood when running this operation or for further customization, see [Under The Hood](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/master/docs/topics/rotate-certs.md#under-the-hood).
