<sup>1</sup> Storage included in the rate for each tier.

<sup>2</sup> Maximum storage allowed for a registry. Operators can offer less storage through quotas.

<sup>3</sup> **ReadOps**, **WriteOps**, and **Bandwidth** vary based on Azure Stack Hub configuration and user workloads.

<sup>4</sup> [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pulling-an-image) translates to multiple read operations based on the number of layers in the image, plus the manifest retrieval.

<sup>5</sup> [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pushing-an-image) translates to multiple write operations, based on the number of layers that must be pushed. A docker push includes *ReadOps* to retrieve a manifest for an existing image.
