# What is Azure Stack Hub?

Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you use Azure services from your company's or service provider's datacenter. As a developer, you can build apps on Azure Stack Hub. You can then deploy them to Azure Stack Hub, to Azure, or you can build truly hybrid apps that leverage the connectivity between an Azure Stack Hub cloud and Azure. Learn how to create resources and deploy apps with our quickstarts and tutorials.

## How to use Azure Stack Hub
