# What is Azure Stack Hub?

Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you use Azure services from your company's or service provider's datacenter. As a developer, you can build apps on Azure Stack Hub. You can then deploy them to Azure Stack Hub, to Azure, or you can build truly hybrid apps that leverage the connectivity between an Azure Stack Hub cloud and Azure. Learn how to create resources and deploy apps with our quickstarts and tutorials.

## How to use Azure Stack Hub

If you're an Azure Stack Hub operator who manages the infrastructure and offers services, check out the [operator documentation](../operator/index.yml).

If you are an Azure Stack Hub user interested in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK), a single-node deployment of Azure Stack Hub that you can download and use for free, see the [ASDK documentation](../asdk/index.yml).
