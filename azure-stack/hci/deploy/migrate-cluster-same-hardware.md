# Migrate to Azure Stack HCI on same hardware

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2, 21H2, and 20H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008 R2

This topic describes how to migrate a Windows Server failover cluster to Azure Stack HCI using your existing server hardware. This process installs the new Azure Stack HCI operating system and retains your existing cluster settings and storage, and imports your VMs.

The following diagram depicts migrating your Windows Server cluster in-place using the same server hardware. After shutting your cluster down, Azure Stack HCI is installed, storage is reattached, and your VMs are imported and made highly available (HA).

To migrate your VMs to new Azure Stack HCI hardware, see [Migrate to Azure Stack HCI on new hardware](migrate-cluster-new-hardware.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Migrating stretched clusters is not covered in this article.

## Before you begin

There are several requirements and things to consider before you begin migration:

- All Windows PowerShell commands must be run As Administrator.

- You must have domain credentials with administrator permissions for Azure Stack HCI.

- Backup all VMs on your source cluster. Complete a crash-consistent backup of all applications and data and an application-consistent backup of all databases.  To backup to Azure, see [Use Azure Backup](/azure/backup/back-up-azure-stack-hyperconverged-infrastructure-virtual-machines).

- Collect inventory and configuration of all cluster nodes and cluster naming, network configuration, Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) resiliency and capacity, and quorum witness.

- Shutdown your cluster VMs, offline CSVs, offline storage pools, and the cluster service.
- Disable the Cluster Name Object (CNO) (it is reused later) and:
    - Check that the CNO has Create Object rights to its own Organizational Unit (OU)
    - Check that the block inherited policy has been set on the OU
    - Set the required policy for Azure Stack HCI on this OU

## VM version support and update

The following table lists supported Windows Server OS versions and their VM versions for in-place migration on the same hardware.

Regardless of the OS version a VM may be running on, the minimum VM version supported for migration to Azure Stack HCI is version 5.0. So any VMs running at version 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 on your Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 cluster must be updated to version 5.0 before migration.

|OS version|VM version|
|---|---|
|Windows Server 2008 SP1|2.0|
|Windows Server 2008 R2|3.0|
|Windows Server 2012|4.0|
|Windows Server 2012 R2|5.0|
|Windows Server 2016|8.0|
|Windows Server 2019|9.0|
|Azure Stack HCI|9.0|

For VMs on Windows Server 2008 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2-SP1, and Windows 2012 clusters, direct migration to Azure Stack HCI is not supported. In these cases, you have two options:

- Migrate these VMs to Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019 first, update the VM version, then begin the migration process.

- Use Robocopy to copy all VM VHDs to Azure Stack HCI. Then create new VMs and attach the copied VHDs to their respective VMs in Azure Stack HCI. This bypasses the VM version limitation for these older VMs.

## Updating the VM version

Use the following command to show all VM versions on a single server:

```powershell
Get-VM * | Format-Table Name,Version
```

To show all VM versions across all nodes on your Windows Server cluster:

```powershell
Get-VM –ComputerName (Get-ClusterNode)
```

To update all VMs to the latest version on all Windows Server nodes:

```powershell
Get-VM –ComputerName (Get-ClusterNode) | Update-VMVersion -Force
```

## Updating the servers and cluster

Migration consists of running Azure Stack HCI setup on your Windows Server deployment for a clean OS install with your VMs and storage intact. This replaces the current operating system with Azure Stack HCI. For detailed information, see [Deploy the Azure Stack HCI operating system](operating-system.md). Afterwards, you create a new Azure Stack HCI cluster, reattach your storage and import the VMs over.

1. Shutdown your existing cluster VMs, offline CSVs, offline storage pools, and the cluster service.

1. Go to the location where you downloaded the Azure Stack HCI bits, then run Azure Stack HCI setup on each Windows Server node.

1. During setup, select **Custom: Install the newer version of Azure Stack HCI only (Advanced)**. Repeat for each server.

1. Create the new Azure Stack HCI cluster. You can use Windows Admin Center or Windows PowerShell to do this, as described below.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hyper-V virtual switch (`VMSwitch`) name must be the same name captured in the cluster configuration inventory. Make sure the virtual switch name used on the Azure Stack HCI cluster matches the original source virtual switch name before you import the VMs.

> [!NOTE]
> You must register the Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure before you can create new VMs on it. For more information, see [Register with Azure](register-with-azure.md).

### Using Windows Admin Center

If using Windows Admin Center to create the Azure Stack HCI cluster, the Create Cluster wizard automatically installs all required roles and features on each server node.

For detailed information on how to create the cluster, see [Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Windows Admin Center](create-cluster.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Skip step **4.1 Clean drives** in the Create cluster wizard. Otherwise you will delete your existing VMs and storage.

1. Start the Create Cluster wizard. When you get to **Step 4: Storage**:

1. Skip step **4.1 Clean drives**. Do not do this.

1. Step away from the wizard.

1. Open PowerShell, and run the following cmdlet to create the new `Storagesubsystem Object` ID, rediscover all storage enclosures, and assign SES drive numbers:

    ```powershell
    Enable-ClusterS2D -Verbose
    ```

    If migrating from Windows Server 2016, this also creates a new `ClusterperformanceHistory` ReFS volume and assigns it to the SDDC Cluster Resource Group.

    If migrating from Windows Server 2019, this also adds the existing `ClusterperformanceHistory` ReFS volume and assigns it to the SDDC Cluster Resource Group.

1. Go back to the wizard. In step **4.2 Verify drives**, verify that all drives are listed without warnings or errors.

1. Complete the wizard.

### Using Windows PowerShell

If using PowerShell to create the Azure Stack HCI cluster, the following roles and features must be installed on each Azure Stack HCI cluster node using the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V, Failover-Clustering, FS-Data-Deduplication, Bitlocker, Data-Center-Bridging, RSAT-AD-PowerShell -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools -Verbose
```

For more information on how to create the cluster using PowerShell, see [Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Windows PowerShell](create-cluster-powershell.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Re-use the same name for the previously disabled Cluster Name Object.

1. Run the following cmdlet to create the cluster:

    ```powershell
    New-cluster –name "clustername" –node Server01,Server02 –staticaddress xx.xx.xx.xx –nostorage
    ```

1. Run the following cmdlet to create the new `Storagesubsystem Object` ID, rediscover all storage enclosures, and assign SES drive numbers:

    ```powershell
    Enable-ClusterS2D -Verbose
    ```

1. If migrating from Windows Server 2016, this also creates a new `ClusterperformanceHistory` ReFS volume and assigns it to the SDDC Cluster Resource Group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a storage pool shows Minority Disk errors (viewable in Cluster Manager), re-run the `Enable-ClusterS2D -verbose` cmdlet.

1. Using Cluster Manager, enable every CSV except the `ClusterperformanceHistory` volume, which is a ReFS volume (make sure this is not an ReFS CSV).

1. If migrating from Windows Server 2019, re-run the `Enable-ClusterS2D -verbose` cmdlet. This will associate the `ClusterperformanceHistory` ReFS volume with the SDDC Cluster Resource Group.

1. Determine your current storage pool name and version by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Get-StoragePool | ? IsPrimordial -eq $false | ft FriendlyName,Version
    ```

1. Now determine your new storage pool name and version:

    ```powershell
    Get-StoragePool | ? IsPrimordial -eq $false | ft FriendlyName,Version
    ```

1. Create the quorum witness. For information on how, see [Set up a cluster witness](../manage/witness.md).

1. Verify that storage repair jobs are completed using the following:

    ```powershell
    Get-StorageJob
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >This could take considerable time depending on the number of VMs running during the upgrade.

1. Verify that all disks are healthy:

    ```powershell
    Get-VirtualDisk
    ```

1. Determine the cluster node version, which displays `ClusterFunctionalLevel` and `ClusterUpgradeVersion`. Run the following to get this:

    ```powershell
    Get-ClusterNodeSupportedVersion
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > `ClusterFunctionalLevel` is automatically set to `10` and does not require updating due to new the operating system and cluster creation.

1. Update your storage pool as follows:

    ```powershell
    Get-StoragePool | Update-StoragePool
    ```

## ReFS volumes

If migrating from Windows Server 2016, Resilient File System (ReFS) volumes are supported, but such volumes do not benefit from performance enhancements in Azure Stack HCI from using mirror-accelerated parity (MAP) volumes. This enhancement requires a new ReFS volume to be created using the PowerShell `New-Volume` cmdlet.

For Windows Server 2016 MAP volumes, ReFS compaction was not available, so re-attaching these volumes is OK but will be less performant compared to creating a new MAP volume in an Azure Stack HCI cluster.

## Import the VMs

A best practice is to create at least one Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) per cluster node to enable an even balance of VMs for each CSV owner for increased resiliency, performance, and scale of VM workloads. By default, this balance occurs automatically every five minutes and needs to be considered when using Robocopy between a source cluster node and the destination cluster node to ensure source and destination CSV owners match to provide the most optimal transfer path and speed.

Perform the following steps on your Azure Stack HCI cluster to import the VMs, make them highly available, and start them:

1. Run the following cmdlet to show all CSV owner nodes:

    ```powershell
    Get-ClusterSharedVolume
    ```

1. For each server node, go to `C:\Clusterstorage\Volume` and set the path for all VMs - for example `C:\Clusterstorage\volume01`.

1. Run the following cmdlet on each CSV owner node to display the path to all VM VMCX files per volume prior to VM import. Modify the path to match your environment:

    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Clusterstorage\Volume01\*.vmcx" -Recurse
    ```

1. Run the following cmdlet for each server node to import and register all VMs and make them highly available on each CSV owner node. This ensures an even distribution of VMs for optimal processor and memory allocation:

    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Clusterstorage\Volume01\*.vmcx" -Recurse | Import-VM -Register | Get-VM | Add-ClusterVirtualMachineRole
    ```

1. Start each destination VM on each node:

    ```powershell
    Start-VM -Name
    ```

1. Login and verify that all VMs are running and that all your apps and data are there:

    ```powershell
    Get-VM -ComputerName Server01 | Where-Object {$_.State -eq 'Running'}
    ```

1. Lastly, update your VMs to the latest Azure Stack HCI version to take advantage of all the advancements:

    ```powershell
    Get-VM | Update-VMVersion -Force
    ```
