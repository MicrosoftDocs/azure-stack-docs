# Deploy Azure Stack HCI interactively (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-supplemental-package.md)]

After you've successfully installed the operating system, you're ready to set up and run the deployment tool. This method of deployment leads you through a guided, UI experience to create a configuration (answer) file interactively that is saved.

You can deploy both single server and multi-node clusters using this procedure.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you've done the following:

- Satisfy the [prerequisites](deployment-tool-prerequisites.md).
- Complete the [deployment checklist](deployment-tool-checklist.md).
- Prepare your [Active Directory](deployment-tool-active-directory.md) environment.
- [Install version 22H2 OS](deployment-tool-install-os.md) on each server.

## Set up the deployment tool

> [!NOTE]
> You need to install and set up the deployment tool only on the first server in the cluster.

1. In the deployment UX, select the **first server listed for the cluster to act as a staging server** during deployment.

1. Sign in to the staging server using local administrative credentials.

1. Copy content from the *Cloud* folder you downloaded previously to any drive other than the C:\ drive.

1. Run PowerShell as administrator.

1. Run the following command to install the deployment tool:

   ```PowerShell
    .\BootstrapCloudDeploymentTool.ps1 
    ```

    This step takes several minutes to complete.

## Run the deployment tool

This procedure collects deployment parameters from you interactively and saves them to a configuration file as you step through the deployment UI. You deploy single-node and multi-node clusters similarly.

If you want to use an existing configuration file you have previously created, see [Deploy using a configuration file](deployment-tool-existing-file.md).

1. Open a web browser from a computer that has network connectivity to the staging server.

1. In the URL field, enter *https://your_staging-server-IP-address*.

1. Accept the security warning displayed by your browser - this is shown because weâ€™re using a self-signed certificate.

1. Authenticate using the local administrator credentials of your staging server.

1. In the deployment UI, on the **Get started deploying Azure Stack** page, select **Create a new config file**, then select either **One server** or **Multiple servers** as applicable for your deployment.

    d. Go back to the deployment screen and provide the Azure registration details:
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-6-registration-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment step 1.1 Provide registration details page." lightbox="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-6-registration-details.png":::

    e. From the dropdown, select the **Azure Active Directory ID** or the tenant ID.

    f. Select the associated subscription. This subscription is used to create the cluster resource, register it with Azure Arc and set up billing.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that you are a [user access administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) on this subscription. This will allow you to manage access to Azure resources, specifically to Arc-enable each server of an Azure Stack HCI cluster.

    g. Select an existing **Azure resource group** from the dropdown to associate with the cluster resource. To create a new resource group, leave the field empty.

    h. Select an **Azure region** from the dropdown or leave the field empty to use the default.

1. On step **1.2 Configure privacy**, set the privacy settings as they apply to your organization.

1. On **step 1.3 Add servers**, follow these steps:

    1. Provide the local administrator credentials. Make sure that the local administrator credentials are identical across all the servers.

    1. Enter the IP address of each server. Add the servers in the right sequence, beginning with the first server.
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > The first server is the staging server from which you are currently running the deployment tool.

    - [SMB Encryption E-W Cluster traffic](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security#smb-encryption).

1. On **step 1.5 Specify Active Directory details**, enter the following:
    1. Provide your **Active Directory domain** name. For example, this would be the fully qualified domain name in `Contoso.com` format.
    1. Enter the **Computer name prefix** used when you prepared the Active Directory.
    1. For **OU**, provide the full distinguished name of the organizational unit (including the domain components) that was created for the deployment. For example, the name would be `"OU=Hci001,DC=contoso,DC=com"`.
    1. Provide the **username** and the **password** for the deployment user account that was created during [Prepare the Active Directory](deployment-tool-active-directory.md) step.

1. On step **2 Networking**, consult with your network administrator to ensure you enter the correct network details.

1. On step **2.1 Check network adapters**, consult with your network administrator to ensure you enter the correct network details. 

    If all the network adapters do not show up and if you have not excluded those, select **Show hidden adapters**. You may also need to check the cabling and the link speeds. While the network interfaces can have identical speeds across the nodes of the cluster, any low speed switch connections could lead to a difference in the overall speed.

1. On step **2.2 Define network intents**, consult with your network administrator to ensure you enter the correct network details.

    When defining the network intents, for this preview release, only the following sets of network intents are supported.

    - one *Management + Compute* intent, one storage intent.
    - one fully converged intent that maps to *Management + Compute + Storage* intent.
    
    The networking intent should match how you've cabled your system. For this release, see the [Validated deployment network patterns](./deployment-tool-introduction.md#validated-network-topologies)

    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-2-network-intents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment step 2.2 network intents page." lightbox="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-2-network-intents.png":::

1. On step **2.3 Provide storage network details**, consult with your network administrator to ensure that you enter the correct network details.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-2-network-storage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment step 2.3 storage network page." lightbox="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-2-network-storage.png":::

1. On step **2.4 Provide management network details**, enter the following input after consulting your network administrator:

    1. In this release, only the static IPs can be assigned and DHCP isn't supported.
    1. For the **Starting IP** and the **Ending IP** range, provide a minimum of 6 free, contiguous IPv4 addresses. This range excludes your host IPs. These IPs are used for infrastructure services such as clustering.
    1. Provide the **Subnet mask** and **Default gateway** for the network.
    1. Provide the IPv4 address of the **DNS servers** in your environment. DNS servers are required because they're used when your server attempts to communicate with Azure or to resolve your server by name in your network. The DNS server you configure must be able to resolve the Active Directory domain.
        
        For high availability, we recommend that you configure a preferred and an alternate DNS server.

1. On step **3.1 Create cluster**, enter the cluster name. This must be the cluster name you used when preparing Active Directory.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-3-create-cluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment step 3.1 create cluster page." lightbox="media/deployment-tool/new-file/deploy-new-step-3-create-cluster.png":::

1. On step **4.1 Set up cluster storage**, select **Set up with empty drives**.

    The deployment tool configures your storage according to the best practices based on the number of nodes in the cluster. The tool also configures at least one infrastructure volume that is used by the deployment orchestrator and one or multiple data volumes for your use.

    If the resiliency configuration for data volumes does not suit your applications, you can delete these volumes and create these again as per your needs.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not delete the infrastructure volume used to store content from the Lifecycle Manager.

    Here is a table summarizing the expected resiliency configuration against the number of nodes in your cluster.

   | # NodeÂ         | Volume resiliencyÂ Â  | # Infrastructure volumesÂ  | # Customer volumesÂ  |
    |---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
    | Single nodeÂ   | Two-way mirrorÂ      | 1Â                         | 1Â                   |
    | Two nodeÂ      | Two-way mirrorÂ      | 2Â                         | 2Â                   |
    | Three node +Â  | Three-way mirrorÂ    | 3Â                         | 1 per node          |

    Select **Next** to continue.
