# Register your servers and assign permissions for Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 deployment (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to register your Azure Stack HCI servers and then set up the required permissions to deploy an Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 cluster.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you've done the following:

- Satisfy the [prerequisites](./deployment-prerequisites.md).
- Complete the [deployment checklist](./deployment-checklist.md).
- Prepare your [Active Directory](./deployment-prep-active-directory.md) environment.
- [Install the Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 operating system](./deployment-install-os.md) on each server.

- If you are registering the servers, make sure that you have `Contributor` permissions and `User Access Administrator` permissions for the subscription. To verify, follow these steps in the Azure portal:
    - Go to the subscription that you will use for Azure Stack HCI deployment.
    - In the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**.
    - In the right pane, go to **Check access > View my access > Role assignments**. Verify that you have the `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles assigned.

    1. Go to the **Users** section. Select the user and go to **Assigned roles**. 
    1. Select **+ Add assignments** and assign the **Cloud Application Administrator** role.

## Register servers with Azure Arc

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run these steps on every Azure Stack HCI server that you intend to cluster.

1. Install the [Arc registration script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzSHCI.ARCInstaller/0.1.2489.42) from PSGallery.

    ```powershell
    #Register PSGallery as a trusted repo
    Register-PSRepository -Default -InstallationPolicy Trusted
    
    #Install Arc registration script from PSGallery 
    Install-Module AzsHCI.ARCinstaller

    #Install required PowerShell modules in your node for registration
    Install-Module Az.Accounts -Force
    Install-Module Az.ConnectedMachine -Force
    Install-Module Az.Resources -Force
    ```

    Here's a sample output of the installation:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Install-Module -Name AzSHCI.ARCInstaller                                           
    NuGet provider is required to continue                                                                                  
    PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet  provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or
    'C:\Users\SetupUser\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by
    running 'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install
    and import the NuGet provider now?
    [Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser>
    
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Install-Module Az.Accounts -Force
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Install-Module Az.ConnectedMachine -Force
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Install-Module Az.Resources -Force
    ```

1. Set the parameters. The script takes in the following parameters:

    |Parameters  |Description  |
    |------------|-------------|
    |`SubscriptionID`    |The ID of the subscription used to register your servers with Azure Arc.         |
    |`TenantID`          |The tenant ID used to register your servers with Azure Arc. Go to your Microsoft Entra ID and copy the tenant ID property.       |
    |`ResourceGroup`     |The resource group precreated for Arc registration of the servers. A resource group is created if one does not exist.         |
    |`Region`            |The Azure region used for registration. For this release, only the `eastus` and `westeurope` are supported.          |
    |`AccountID`         |The user who will register and deploy the cluster.         |
    |`DeviceCode`        |The device code displayed in the console at `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` and is used to sign in to the device.         |
    

   ```powershell
    #Define the subscription where you want to register your server as Arc device
    $Subscription = "YourSubscriptionID"
    
    #Define the resource group where you want to register your server as Arc device
    $RG = "YourResourceGroupName"
    
    #Define the tenant you will use to register your server as Arc device
    $Tenant = "YourTenantID"

    #Define the Azure region used for registration.
    $Region = "YourRegionName"
    ```

    Here's a sample output of the parameters:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Subscription = "<Subscription ID>"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $RG = "myashcirg"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Tenant = "<Tenant ID>"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Region = "eastus"
    ```

1. Connect to your Azure account and set the subscription. You will need to open browser on the client that you are using to connect to the server and open this page: `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` and enter the provided code in the Azure CLI output to authenticate. Get the access token and account ID for the registration.  

    ```powershell
    #Connect to your Azure account and Subscription
    Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId $Subscription -TenantId $Tenant -DeviceCode

    #Get the Access Token for the registration
    $ARMtoken = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token

    #Get the Account ID for the registration
    $id = (Get-AzContext).Account.Id   
    ``` 

    Here's a sample output of the setting the subscription and authentication:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId $Subscription -TenantId $Tenant -DeviceCode
    WARNING: To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code A44KHK5B5
    to authenticate.
    
    Account               SubscriptionName      TenantId                Environment
    -------               ----------------      --------                -----------
    guspinto@contoso.com AzureStackHCI_Content  <Tenant ID>             AzureCloud

    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $ARMtoken = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $id = (Get-AzContext).Account.Id
    ```
 
1. Finally run the Arc registration script. The script takes a few minutes to run.

    ```powershell
    #Invoke the registration script. For this preview release, eastus and westeurope regions are supported.
    Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -TenantID $Tenant -Region $Region -Cloud "AzureCloud" -ArmAccessToken $ARMtoken -AccountID $id  
    ```

    If you are accessing the internet via a proxy server, you need to pass the `--proxy` parameter and provide the proxy server as `http://<Proxy server FQDN or IP address>:Port` when running the script. 

    Here is a sample output of a successful registration of your servers:
    
    ```output
    PS C:\DeploymentPackage> Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -TenantID $Tenant -Region $Region -Cloud "AzureCloud" -ArmAccessToken $ARMtoken -AccountID $id -Force

1. After the script has completed successfully on all the servers, verify that:


    1. Your servers are registered with Arc. Go to the Azure portal and then go to the resource group associated with the registration. The servers appear within the specified resource group as **Machine - Azure Arc** type resources.

    1. The mandatory Azure Stack HCI extensions are installed on your servers. From the resource group, select the registered server. Go to the **Extensions**. The mandatory extensions show up in the right pane.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In some instances, running the Arc registration script doesn't install the mandatory extensions, Azure Edge device Management or Azure Edge Lifecycle Manager. The workaround is to run the script again and make sure that all the mandatory extensions are installed before you [Deploy via Azure portal](../deploy/deploy-via-portal.md).


## Assign required permissions for deployment

This section describes how to assign Azure permissions for deployment from the Azure portal.


1. In the Azure portal, go to the resource group used to register the servers on your subscription. In the left pane, select **Access control (IAM)**. In the right pane, select **+ Add** and from the dropdown list, select **Add role assignment**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-arc-register-server-permissions/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add role assignment in Access control in resource group for Azure Stack HCI deployment." lightbox="./media/deployment-arc-register-server-permissions/add-role-assignment.png":::

1. Go through the tabs and assign `Key Vault Administrator` permissions to the user who will deploy the cluster.
