# Install the Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 operating system (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-supplemental-package.md)]

The Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 operating system (OS) is installed locally on each server in your cluster.
The installation includes one *Cloud* folder that contains the deployment tool used to deploy a cluster.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you've done the following:

- Satisfy the [prerequisites](deployment-tool-prerequisites.md).
- Complete the [deployment checklist](deployment-tool-checklist.md).
- Prepare your [Active Directory](deployment-tool-active-directory.md) environment.

## Files and folders

The *Cloud* folder included with the installation contains the following files:

|File|Description|
|--|--|
|*CloudDeployment_*.zip*|Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 content images and agents.|
|*BoostrapCloudDeploymentTool.ps1*|Hash script to extract content and launch the deployment tool. When this script is run with the `-ExtractOnly` parameter, it will extract the zip file, but not launch the deployment tool.|
|*Verify-CloudDeployment_buildnumber.zip_Hash.ps1*|Hash used to validate the integrity of the .zip file.|

## Boot and install the OS

To install the Azure Stack HCI operating system, follow these steps:

1. The first step is to [Download Azure Stack HCI 22H2](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hci/hci-download/).

1. You'll need to fill out and submit a trial form. On the Azure Stack HCI software download form page, select **Download Azure Stack HCI**. This action downloads an ISO file that you'll use to install the operating system on each server that you want to cluster.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-download.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Stack HCI download.":::

1. Start the **Install Azure Stack HCI** wizard on the system drive of the server where you want to install the operating system.
1. Choose the language to install or accept the default language settings, select **Next**, and then on next page of the wizard, select **Install now**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-install-language.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the language page of the Install Azure Stack HCI wizard.":::

1. On the **Applicable notices and license terms** page, review the license terms, select the **I accept the license terms** checkbox, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Which type of installation do you want?** page, select **Custom: Install the newer version of Azure Stack HCI only (advanced)**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Upgrade installations are not supported in this release of the operating system.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-install-which-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the installation type option page of the Install Azure Stack HCI wizard.":::

1. On the **Where do you want to install Azure Stack HCI?** page, make sure that a special disk partition layout is created:

    | Disk partition         | Recommended min. size | Purpose                  |
    |------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
    | Boot partition (C:)    |60 GB<sup>*</sup>                  |Used for the OS           |
    | Data partition (D:)    |120 GB                 |Used for logs, crash dumps |

    <sup>*</sup> - *The minimum requirement should be based on the memory required to ensure a full memory dump can be created. For more information, see [Overview of memory dump file options for Windows](/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/memory-dump-file-options).*

    Confirm the OS installation in the boot partition, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-install-where.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the drive location page of the Install Azure Stack HCI wizard.":::

1. The **Installing Azure Stack HCI** page displays to show status on the process.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-installing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the status page of the Install Azure Stack HCI wizard.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The installation process restarts the operating system twice to complete the process, and displays notices on starting services before opening an Administrator command prompt.

1. At the Administrator command prompt, select **Ok** to change the user's password before signing in to the operating system, and press **Enter**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/operating-system/azure-stack-hci-change-admin-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the change password prompt.":::

1. At the **Enter new credential** for Administrator prompt, enter a new password. Enter the password again to confirm it, and then press **Enter**.

1. At the **Your password has been changed** confirmation prompt, press Enter.

Now you're ready to use the Server Configuration tool (SConfig) to perform important tasks. To use *SConfig*, log on to the server running the Azure Stack HCI operating system. This could be locally via a keyboard and monitor, or using a remote management (headless or BMC) controller, or Remote Desktop. The *SConfig* tool opens automatically when you log on to the server.

## Configure the OS using SConfig

You can use [*SConfig*](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SCONFIG/2.0.1)to configure Azure Stack HCI version 22H2 after installation as follows:

1. Configure networking as per your environment.

1. Configure a default valid gateway and a DNS server.

1. Rename the server(s) using option 2 in *SConfig* to match what you have used when preparing Active Directory, as you wonâ€™t rename the servers later.

1. Restart the servers.

1. Set the local administrator credentials to be identical across all servers.

1. Install the latest drivers and firmware as per the instructions provided by your hardware manufacturer. You can use *SConfig* to run driver installation apps. After the install is complete, restart your servers again.

## Install required Windows Roles

> [!NOTE]
> Skip this step if deployment is via the PowerShell. This step is required only if you deploy via the deployment tool.

1. Install the Hyper-V role. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
    ```

    Your servers will restart and this will take a few minutes.

1. After the servers have restarted, use the option 15 in *SConfig* to launch the PowerShell session.

1. Skip this step if you're deploying a single server.

    1. For a multi-node cluster, go to the first server of your cluster. Run the following command:

        ```powershell
        Set-Item Wsman:\Localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value *
        ```

    1. On all other subsequent nodes (excluding the first server), run the following command:

        ```powershell
        winrm quickconfig
        ```

    1. Finally, enable ICMP. This command is required for the other nodes to access the first node.
    
        ```azurepowershell
        netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="ICMP Allow incoming V4 echo request" protocol=icmpv4:8,any dir=in action=allow
        ```

## Next steps

After installing the Azure Stack HCI version 22H2 OS, you're ready to install, configure, and run the deployment tool in Windows Admin Center. You can either create a new deployment configuration file interactively or use an existing configuration file you created:

- [Deploy using a new configuration file](deployment-tool-new-file.md).
- [Deploy using an existing configuration file](deployment-tool-existing-file.md).

- If preferred, you can also [deploy using PowerShell](deployment-tool-powershell.md).
