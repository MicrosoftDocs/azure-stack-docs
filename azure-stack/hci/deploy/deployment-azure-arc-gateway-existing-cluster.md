# Simplify outbound network requirements for existing Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 clusters through Azure Arc gateway (preview)

Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2

This article describes how to set up an Azure Arc Gateway for existing deployments of Azure Stack HCI running software version 2405.

You can use the Arc gateway to significantly reduce the number of required endpoints needed to deploy and manage Azure Stack HCI clusters. You can enable the Arc gateway for new deployments or for existing deployments. 

<!--This article only covers the existing Azure Stack HCI deployments. For new deployments, see [Enable Azure Arc gateway for existing Azure Stack HCI deployments](deployment-azure-arc-gateway-new-cluster.md). To use the Arc gateway on standalone Arc for Servers scenarion, see [How to simplify network configuration requirements through Azure Arc gateway](/azure/azure-arc/servers/arc-gateway).-->

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A completed [Arc gateway Preview signup form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2WRja4SbkFJm6k6LDfxchxUN1dYTlZIM1JYTVFCN0RVTjgyVEZHMkFTSC4u).
- An Arc gateway resource in Azure. To create the resource, follow the steps in [Create the Arc gateway resource in Azure](./deployment-azure-arc-gateway-overview.md#create-the-arc-gateway-resource-in-azure).
- An existing Azure Stack cluster running software version 2405 or later.
  - The servers in the cluster must be running the Azure Connected Machine agent version 1.40 or later.

## Enable Arc gateway for existing Azure Stack HCI deployments

The following steps are required to enable the Azure Arc gateway on existing Azure Stack HCI 2405 deployments.

0. Create the Arc gateway resource in Azure (prerequisite).
1. Download the az connected machine extension to your HCI nodes.
2. Associate the Arc gateway resource with your existing Azure Stack HCI cluster.
3. Update Arc agent configuration on each deployed Azure Stack HCI server to use the Arc gateway ID.
4. Await reconciliation.
5. Verify that supported endpoints are redirected through the Arc gateway.


## Step 1: Download the az connected machine extension to your HCI nodes.

Download the [az connectedmachine.whl](https://aka.ms/ArcGatewayWhl) file extension.

Run the following command to add the az connected machine extension:

```azurecli
az extension add --allow-preview true --yes --source [whl file path] 
```

## Step 2: Associate the Arc gateway resource with your existing Azure Stack HCI cluster


Associate each existing server in the cluster with the Arc gateway resource. Run the following command:

```azurecli
az connectedmachine setting update --resource-group [res-group] --subscription [subscription name] --base-provider Microsoft.HybridCompute --base-resource-type machines --base-resource-name [Arc server resource name] -settings-resource-name default --gateway-resource-id [Full Arm resourceid]
```

## Step 3: Update the machine to use the Arc gateway resource  

Update each server in the cluster to use the Arc gateway resource. Run the following command on your Arc-enabled server to set it to use the Arc gateway:

```azurecli
azcmagent config set connection.type gateway
```

## Step 4: Await reconciliation

Await reconciliation. Once your servers have been updated to use the Arc gateway, some Azure Arc endpoints that were previously allowed in your proxy or firewalls won't be needed any longer. Wait one hour before you begin removing endpoints from your firewall or proxy.

Next step is to verify that the setup was successful.

## Step 5: Verify that setup succeeded

## Troubleshooting  

You can audit Arc gateway traffic by viewing the gateway router logs.  

Follow these steps to view the logs:

1. Run the `azcmagent logs` command.

1. In the resulting .zip file, view the logs in the *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ArcGatewayRouter* folder.
