# Validate an Azure Stack HCI cluster

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 21H2 and 20H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019

Although the Create cluster wizard in Windows Admin Center performs certain validations to create a working cluster with the selected hardware, cluster validation performs additional checks to make sure the cluster will work in a production environment. This how-to article focuses on why cluster validation is important, and when to run it on an Azure Stack HCI cluster.

We recommend performing cluster validation for the following primary scenarios:

- After deploying a server cluster, run the Validate-DCB tool to test networking.
- After updating a server cluster, depending on your scenario, run both validation options to troubleshoot cluster issues.
- After setting up replication with Storage Replica, validate that the replication is proceeding normally by checking some specific events and running a couple commands.
- After creating a server cluster, run the Validate-DCB tool before placing it into production.

## What is cluster validation?
Cluster validation is intended to catch hardware or configuration problems before a cluster goes into production. Cluster validation helps to ensure that the Azure Stack HCI solution that you're about to deploy is truly dependable. You can also use cluster validation on configured failover clusters as a diagnostic tool.

## Specific validation scenarios
This section describes scenarios in which validation is also needed or useful.

- **Validation before the cluster is configured:**
  - **A set of servers ready to become a failover cluster:** This is the most straightforward validation scenario. The hardware components (systems, networks, and storage) are connected, but the systems aren't yet functioning as a cluster. Running tests in this situation has no affect on availability.
 
  - **Server VMs:** For virtualized servers in a cluster, run cluster validation as you would on any other new cluster. The requirement to run the feature is the same whether you have:
    - A "host cluster" where failover occurs between two physical computers.
    - A "guest cluster" where failover occurs between guest operating systems on the same physical computer.
 
- **Validation after the cluster is configured and in use:**

  - **Before adding a server to the cluster:** When you add a server to a cluster, we strongly recommend validating the cluster. Specify both the existing cluster members and the new server when you run cluster validation.
  
  - **When adding drives:** When you add additional drives to the cluster, which is different from replacing failed drives or creating virtual disks or volumes that rely on the existing drives, run cluster validation to confirm that the new storage will function correctly.

  - **When making changes that affect firmware or drivers:** If you upgrade or make changes to the cluster that affect firmware or drivers, you must run cluster validation to confirm that the new combination of hardware, firmware, drivers, and software supports failover cluster functionality.

  - **After restoring a system from backup:** After you restore a system from backup, run cluster validation to confirm that the system functions correctly as part of a cluster.

## Validate networking
The Microsoft Validate-DCB tool is designed to validate the Data Center Bridging (DCB) configuration on the cluster. To do this, the tool takes an expected configuration as input, and then tests each server in the cluster. This section covers how to install and run the Validate-DCB tool, review results, and resolve networking errors that the tool identifies.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends deploying and managing your configuration with Network ATC, which eliminates most of the configuration challenges that the Validate-DCB tool checks for. To learn more about Network ATC, which provides an intent-based approach to host network deployment, see [Simplify host networking with Network ATC](network-atc.md).

On the network, remote direct memory access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) requires DCB technologies to make the network fabric lossless. With iWARP, DCB is optional. However, configuring DCB can be complex, with exact configuration required across:
- Each server in the cluster
- Each network port that RDMA traffic passes through on the fabric

### Prerequisites
- Network setup information of the server cluster that you want to validate, including:
    - Host or server cluster name
    - Virtual switch name
    - Network adapter names
    - Priority Flow Control (PFC) and Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS) settings
- An internet connection to download the tool module in Windows PowerShell from Microsoft.

### Install and run the Validate-DCB tool
To install and run the Validate-DCB tool:
1. On your management PC, open a Windows PowerShell session as an Administrator, and then use the following command to install the tool.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Validate-DCB
    ```

1. Accept the requests to use the NuGet provider and access the repository to install the tool.
1. After PowerShell connects to the Microsoft network to download the tool, type `Validate-DCB` and press **Enter** to start the tool wizard.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you cannot run the Validate-DCB tool script, you might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policies. Use the Get-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet to view your current script execution policy settings. For information on setting execution policies in PowerShell, see [About Execution Policies](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7&preserve-view=true).

1. On the Welcome to the Validate-DCB configuration wizard page, select **Next**.
1. On the Clusters and Nodes page, type the name of the server cluster that you want to validate, select **Resolve** to list it on the page, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/clusters-and-nodes.png" alt-text="The Clusters and Nodes page of the Validate-DCB configuration wizard":::

1. On the Adapters page:
   1. Select the **vSwitch attached** checkbox and type the name of the vSwitch.
   1. Under **Adapter Name**, type the name of each physical NIC, under **Host vNIC Name**, the name of each virtual NIC (vNIC), and under **VLAN**, the VLAN ID in use for each adapter.
   1. Expand the **RDMA Type** drop-down list box and select the appropriate protocol: **RoCE** or **iWARP**. Also set **Jumbo Frames** to the appropriate value for your network, and then select **Next**.

1. On the Data Center Bridging page, modify the values to match your organization's settings for **Priority**, **Policy Name**, and **Bandwidth Reservation**, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/data-center-bridging.png" alt-text="The Data Center Bridging page of the Validate-DCB configuration wizard" lightbox="../media/validate/data-center-bridging.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting RDMA over RoCE on the previous wizard page requires DCB for network reliability on all NICs and switchports.

1. On the Save and Deploy page, in the **Configuration File Path** box, save the configuration file using a .ps1 extension to a location where you can use it again later if needed, and then select **Export** to start running the Validate-DCB tool.

   - You can optionally deploy your configuration file by completing the **Deploy Configuration to Nodes** section of the page, which includes the ability to use an Azure Automation account to deploy the configuration and then validate it. See [Create an Azure Automation account](/azure/automation/automation-quickstart-create-account) to get started with Azure Automation.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/save-and-deploy.png" alt-text="The Save and Deploy page of the Validate-DCB configuration wizard":::

### Review results and fix errors
The Validate-DCB tool produces results in two units:
1. [Global Unit] results list prerequisites and requirements to run the modal tests.
1. [Modal Unit] results provide feedback on each cluster host configuration and best practices.

This example shows successful scan results of a single server for all prerequisites and modal unit tests by indicating a Failed Count of 0.

:::image type="content" source="../media/validate/global-unit-and-modal-unit-results.png" alt-text="Validate-DCB Global unit and Modal unit test results":::

The following steps show how to identify a Jumbo Packet error from vNIC SMB02 and fix it:
1. The results of the Validate-DCB tool scans show a Failed Count error of 1.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/failed-count-error-1.png" alt-text="Validate-DCB tool scan results showing a a Failed Count error of 1":::

1. Scrolling back through the results shows an error in red indicating that the Jumbo Packet for vNIC SMB02 on Host S046036 is set at the default size of 1514, but should be set to 9014.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/jumbo-packet-setting-error.png" alt-text="Validate-DCB tool scan result showing a jumbo packet size setting error":::

1. Reviewing the **Advanced** properties of vNIC SMB02 on Host S046036 shows that the Jumbo Packet is set to the default of **Disabled**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/hyper-v-advanced-properties-jumbo-packet-setting.png" alt-text="The Server host's Hyper-V Advanced properties Jumbo Packet setting":::

1. Fixing the error requires enabling the Jumbo Packet feature and changing its size to 9014 bytes. Running the scan again on host S046036 confirms this change by returning a Failed Count of 0.

## Validate the cluster
Use the following steps to validate the servers in an existing cluster in Windows Admin Center.

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All connections**, select the Azure Stack HCI cluster that you want to validate, and then select **Connect**.

    The **Cluster Manager Dashboard** displays overview information about the cluster.

1. On the **Cluster Manager Dashboard**, under **Tools**, select **Servers**.
1. On the **Inventory** page, select the servers in the cluster, then expand the **More** submenu and select **Validate cluster**.
1. On the **Validate Cluster** pop-up window, select **Yes**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/validate/validate-cluster-pop-up.png" alt-text="Validate Cluster pop-up window":::

1. On the **Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP)** pop-up window, select **Yes**.
1. Provide your credentials to enable **CredSSP** and then select **Continue**.<br> Cluster validation runs in the background and gives you a notification when it's complete, at which point you can view the validation report, as described in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> After your cluster servers have been validated, you will need to disable CredSSP for security reasons.

### Disable CredSSP
After your server cluster is successfully validated, you'll need to disable the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol on each server for security purposes. For more information, see [CVE-2018-0886](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886).

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All connections**, select the first server in your cluster, and then select **Connect**.
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Disable CredSSP**, and then on the **Disable CredSSP** pop-up window, select **Yes**.

    The result of Step 2 removes the red **CredSSP ENABLED** banner at the top of the server's **Overview** page, and disables CredSSP on the other servers.

### View validation reports
Now you're ready to view your cluster validation report.

There are a couple ways to access validation reports:
- On the **Inventory** page, expand the **More** submenu, and then select **View validation reports**.


- At the top right of **Windows Admin Center**, select the **Notifications** bell icon to display the **Notifications** pane.
Select the **Successfully validated cluster** notice, and then select **Go to Failover Cluster validation report**.

> [!NOTE]
> The server cluster validation process may take some time to complete. Don't switch to another tool in Windows Admin Center while the process is running. In the **Notifications** pane, a status bar below your **Validate cluster** notice indicates when the process is done.

## Validate the cluster using PowerShell
You can also use Windows PowerShell to run validation tests on your server cluster and view the results. You can run tests both before and after a cluster is set up.

To run a validation test on a server cluster, issue the **Get-Cluster** and **Test-Cluster** \<server clustername\> PowerShell cmdlets from your management PC, or run only the **Test-Cluster** cmdlet directly on the cluster:

```PowerShell
$Cluster = Get-Cluster -Name 'server-cluster1'
Test-Cluster -InputObject $Cluster -Verbose
```

For more examples and usage information, see the [Test-Cluster](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/test-cluster?view=win10-ps&preserve-view=true) reference documentation.

## Validate replication for Storage Replica
If you're using Storage Replica to replicate volumes in a stretched cluster or cluster-to-cluster, there are there are several events and cmdlets that you can use to get the state of replication. 

In the following scenario, we configured Storage Replica by creating replication groups (RGs) for two sites, and then specified the data volumes and log volumes for both the source server nodes in Site1 (Server1, Server2), and the destination (replicated) server nodes in Site2 (Server3, Server4).

To determine the replication progress for Server1 in Site1, run the Get-WinEvent command and examine events 5015, 5002, 5004, 1237, 5001, and 2200:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ComputerName Server1 -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica -max 20
```

For Server3 in Site2, run the following `Get-WinEvent` command to see the Storage Replica events that show creation of the partnership. This event states the number of copied bytes and the time taken. For example:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ComputerName Server3 -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica | Where-Object {$_.ID -eq "1215"} | FL
```

For Server3 in Site2, run the `Get-WinEvent` command and examine events 5009, 1237, 5001, 5015, 5005, and 2200 to understand the processing progress. There should be no warnings of errors in this sequence. There will be many 1237 events - these indicate progress.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ComputerName Server3 -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica | FL
```

Alternately, the destination server group for the replica states the number of byte remaining to copy at all times, and can be queried through PowerShell with `Get-SRGroup`. For example:

```powershell
(Get-SRGroup).Replicas | Select-Object numofbytesremaining
```

For node Server3 in Site2, run the following command and examine events 5009, 1237, 5001, 5015, 5005, and 2200 to understand the replication progress. There should be no warnings of errors. However, there will be many "1237" events - these simply indicate progress.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ComputerName Server3 -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica | FL
```

As a progress script that will not terminate:

```powershell
while($true) {
$v = (Get-SRGroup -Name "Replication2").replicas | Select-Object numofbytesremaining
[System.Console]::Write("Number of bytes remaining: {0}`r", $v.numofbytesremaining)
Start-Sleep -s 5
}
```

To get replication state within the stretched cluster, use `Get-SRGroup` and `Get-SRPartnership`:

```powershell
Get-SRGroup -Cluster ClusterS1
```

```powershell
Get-SRPartnership -Cluster ClusterS1
```

```powershell
(Get-SRGroup).replicas -Cluster ClusterS1
```

Once successful data replication is confirmed between sites, you can create your VMs and other workloads.
