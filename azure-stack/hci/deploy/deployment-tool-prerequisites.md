# Review deployment prerequisites for Azure Stack HCI (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-supplemental-package.md)]

This article discusses the security, software, hardware, and networking prerequisites in order to deploy Azure Stack HCI.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Security considerations

Review the [security considerations](../manage/preview-channel.md) and [assess environment readiness](../manage/use-environment-checker.md) for Azure Stack HCI.

## Software requirements

You must install Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 operating system using the instructions in [Deploy Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 OS](./deployment-tool-install-os.md).

## Hardware requirements

Before you begin, make sure that the physical hardware used to deploy the solution meets the following requirements:

|Component|Minimum|
|--|--|
|CPU|A 64-bit Intel Nehalem grade or AMD EPYC or later compatible processor with second-level address translation (SLAT).|
|Memory|A minimum of 32 GB RAM.|
|Host network adapters|At least two network adapters listed in the Windows Server Catalog. Or dedicated network adapters per intent, which does require two separate adapters for storage intent. For more information, see [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/).|
|BIOS|Intel VT or AMD-V must be turned on.|
|Boot drive|A minimum size of 200 GB size.|
|Data drives|At least 3 disks with a minimum capacity of 500 GB (SSD or HDD).|
|TPM|TPM 2.0 hardware must be present and turned on.|
|Secure boot|Secure Boot must be present and turned on.|

## Network requirements

Before you begin, make sure that the physical network and the host network where the solution is deployed meet the requirements described in:

- [Physical network requirements](../concepts/physical-network-requirements.md)
- [Host network requirements](../concepts/host-network-requirements.md)

## Next steps

- Review the [deployment checklist](deployment-tool-checklist.md).
