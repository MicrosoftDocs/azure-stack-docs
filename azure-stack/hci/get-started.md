# Get started with Azure Stack HCI and Windows Admin Center

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2-20h2](../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2-20h2.md)]

This topic provides instructions for connecting to an Azure Stack HCI cluster, and for monitoring cluster and storage performance. If you haven't set up a cluster yet, [download Azure Stack HCI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack/hci/hci-download/) and see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Stack HCI cluster and register it with Azure](deploy/deployment-quickstart.md) for instructions.

## Install Windows Admin Center

Windows Admin Center is a locally deployed, browser-based app for managing Azure Stack HCI. The simplest way to [install Windows Admin Center](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/deploy/install) is on a local management PC (desktop mode), although you can also install it on a server (service mode). 

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure AD authentication, install Windows Admin Center on a server.

If you install Windows Admin Center on a server, tasks that require CredSSP, such as cluster creation and installing updates and extensions, require using an account that's a member of the Gateway Administrators group on the Windows Admin Center server. For more information, see the first two sections of [Configure User Access Control and Permissions](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/configure/user-access-control#gateway-access-role-definitions).

## Add and connect to an Azure Stack HCI cluster

After you have completed the installation of Windows Admin Center, you can add a cluster to manage from the main overview page.

1. Click **+ Add** under **All Connections**.

2. Choose to add a Windows Server cluster:

3. Type the name of the cluster to manage and click **Add**. The cluster will be added to your connection list on the overview page.

4. Under **All Connections**, click the name of the cluster you just added. Windows Admin Center will start **Cluster Manager** and take you directly to the Windows Admin Center dashboard for that cluster.

## Monitor cluster performance with the Windows Admin Center dashboard

The Windows Admin Center dashboard provides alerts and health information about servers, drives, and volumes, as well as details about CPU, memory, and storage usage. The bottom of the dashboard displays cluster performance information such as IOPS and latency by hour, day, week, month, or year.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/dashboard.png" alt-text="Windows Admin Center Dashboard Screenshot":::

## Monitor performance of individual components

The **Tools** menu to the left of the dashboard allows you to drill down on any component of the cluster to view summaries and inventories of virtual machines, servers, volumes, and drives.

### Virtual machines

To view a summary of virtual machines that are running on the cluster, click **Virtual machines** from the **Tools** menu at the left.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/vms-summary.png" alt-text="Virtual Machine Summary":::

For a complete inventory of virtual machines running on the cluster along with their state, host server, CPU usage, memory pressure, memory demand, assigned memory, and uptime, click **Inventory** at the top of the page.

### Servers

To view a summary of the servers in the cluster, click **Servers** from the **Tools** menu at the left.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/servers-summary.png" alt-text="Servers Summary":::

For a complete inventory of servers in the cluster including their status, uptime, manufacturer, model, and serial number, click **Inventory** at the top of the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/servers-inventory.png" alt-text="Servers Inventory":::

### Volumes

To view a summary of volumes on the cluster, click **Volumes** from the **Tools** menu at the left.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/volumes-summary.png" alt-text="Volumes Summary":::

For a complete inventory of volumes on the cluster including their status, file system, resiliency, size, storage usage, and IOPS, click **Inventory** at the top of the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/volumes-inventory.png" alt-text="Volumes Inventory":::

### Drives

To view a summary of drives in the cluster, click **Drives** from the **Tools** menu at the left.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started/drives-summary.png" alt-text="Drives Summary":::

For a complete inventory of drives in the cluster along with their serial number, status, model, size, type, use, location, server, and capacity, click **Inventory** at the top of the page.

### Virtual switches

To view the settings for a virtual switch in the cluster, click **Virtual switches** from the **Tools** menu at the left, then click the name of the virtual switch you want to display the settings for. Windows Admin Center will display the network adapters associated with the virtual switch, including their IP addresses, connection state, link speed, and MAC address.

## Add counters with the Performance Monitor tool

Use the Performance Monitor tool to view and compare performance counters for Windows, apps, or devices in real-time.

1. Select **Performance Monitor** from the **Tools** menu on the left.
2. Click **blank workspace** to start a new workspace, or **restore previous** to restore a previous workspace.
    :::image type="content" source="media/get-started/performance-monitor.png" alt-text="Performance Monitor Screenshot":::
3. If creating a new workspace, click the **Add counter** button and select one or more source servers to monitor, or select the entire cluster.
4. Select the object and instance you wish to monitor, as well as the counter and graph type to view dynamic performance information.
    :::image type="content" source="media/get-started/example-counter.png" alt-text="Example Counter Screenshot":::
5. Save the workspace by choosing **Save > Save As** from the top menu.

## Collect diagnostics information

Select **Diagnostics** from the **Tools** menu to collect information for troubleshooting problems with your cluster. If you call Microsoft Support, they may ask for this information.
