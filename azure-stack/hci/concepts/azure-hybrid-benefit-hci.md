# Azure Hybrid Benefit for Azure Stack HCI

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2.md)]

This article describes Azure Hybrid Benefit and how to use it for Azure Stack HCI.

[Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) is a program that helps you reduce the costs of running workloads in the cloud. With Azure Hybrid Benefit for Azure Stack HCI, you can maximize the value of your on-premises licenses and modernize your existing infrastructure to Azure Stack HCI at no additional cost.

## What is Azure Hybrid Benefit for Azure Stack HCI?

If you have [Windows Server Datacenter licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/windows-server?rtc=2) with active [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default), you are eligible to activate Azure Hybrid Benefit for your Azure Stack HCI cluster. To activate this benefit, you'll need to exchange 1-core license of Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server Datacenter for 1-physical core of Azure Stack HCI. For detailed licensing requirements, see [Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit#getting-azure-hybrid-benefit-for-azure-stack-hci).

This benefit waives the Azure Stack HCI host service fee and Windows Server guest subscription on your cluster. Other costs associated with Azure Stack HCI, such as Azure services, are billed as per normal. For details about pricing with Azure Hybrid Benefit, see [Azure Stack HCI pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-stack/hci/).

> [!TIP]
> You can maximize cost savings by also using Azure Hybrid Benefit for AKS. For more information, see [Azure Hybrid Benefits for AKS](/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit#getting-azure-hybrid-benefit-for-aks).

## Activate Azure Hybrid Benefit for Azure Stack HCI

You can activate Azure Hybrid Benefit for your Azure Stack HCI cluster using the Azure portal.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to activate Azure Hybrid Benefit for your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

- Make sure your Azure Stack HCI cluster is installed with the following:

    - Version 22H2 or later; or
    - Version 21H2 with at least the September 13, 2022 security update [KB5017316](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/september-13-2022-security-update-kb5017316-0f0e00f9-a27c-496d-81b7-aa3b3bb010bc) or later
    
- Make sure that all servers in your cluster are online and [registered](../deploy/register-with-azure.md?tab=windows-admin-center#register-a-cluster) with Azure

- Make sure that your cluster has Windows Server Datacenter licenses with active Software Assurance. For other licensing prerequisites, see [Licensing prerequisites](/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit#licensing-prerequisites-1)

- Make sure you have permission to write to the Azure Stack HCI resource. This is included if you're assigned the [contributor or owner role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) on your subscription
