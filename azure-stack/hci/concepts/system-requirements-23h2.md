# System requirements for Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

 This article discusses Azure, server and storage, networking, and other requirements for Azure Stack HCI. If you purchase Azure Stack HCI Integrated System solution hardware from the [Azure Stack HCI Catalog](https://aka.ms/AzureStackHCICatalog), you can skip to the [Networking requirements](#networking-requirements) since the hardware already adheres to server and storage requirements.

## Azure requirements

Here are the Azure requirements for your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

- **Azure subscription**: If you don't already have an Azure account, [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/). You can use an existing subscription of any type:

   - Free account with Azure credits [for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) or [Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).
   - [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) subscription with credit card.
   - Subscription obtained through an Enterprise Agreement (EA).
   - Subscription obtained through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.

- **Azure permissions**: Make sure that you're assigned the required roles and permissions for registration and deployment. For information on how to assign permissions, see [Assign Azure permissions for registration](../deploy/deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md#assign-required-permissions-for-deployment).

- **Azure regions**: Azure Stack HCI is supported for the following regions:

   - East US
   - West Europe
   - Australia East
   - Southeast Asia
   - India Central
   - Canada Central
   - Japan East
   - South Central US

## Server and storage requirements

Before you begin, make sure that the physical server and storage hardware used to deploy an Azure Stack HCI cluster meets the following requirements:

|Component|Minimum|
|--|--|
|Number of servers| 1 to 16 servers are supported. <br> Each server must be the same model, manufacturer, have the same network adapters, and have the same number and type of storage drives.|
|CPU|A 64-bit Intel Nehalem grade or AMD EPYC or later compatible processor with second-level address translation (SLAT).|
|Memory|A minimum of 32-GB RAM per node.|
|Host network adapters|At least two network adapters listed in the Windows Server Catalog. Or dedicated network adapters per intent, which does require two separate adapters for storage intent. For more information, see [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/).|
|BIOS|Intel VT or AMD-V must be turned on.|
|Boot drive|A minimum size of 200-GB size.|
|Data drives|At least two disks with a minimum capacity of 500 GB (SSD or HDD).<br>Single servers must use only a single drive type: Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) or Solid-State (SSD) drives.|
|Trusted Platform Module (TPM)|TPM version 2.0 hardware must be present and turned on.|
|Secure boot|Secure Boot must be present and turned on.|

The servers should also meet this extra requirement:

- Have direct-attached drives that are physically attached to one server each. RAID controller cards or SAN (Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE) storage, shared SAS enclosures connected to multiple servers, or any form of multi-path IO (MPIO) where drives are accessible by multiple paths, aren't supported.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Host-bus adapter (HBA) cards must implement simple pass-through mode for any storage devices used for Storage Spaces Direct.

For more feature-specific requirements for Hyper-V, see [System requirements for Hyper-V on Windows Server](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/system-requirements-for-hyper-v-on-windows).

## Networking requirements

An Azure Stack HCI cluster requires a reliable high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection between each server node.

Verify that physical switches in your network are configured to allow traffic on any VLANs you use. For more information, see [Physical network requirements for Azure Stack HCI](../concepts/physical-network-requirements.md).

<!--## Maximum supported hardware specifications

Azure Stack HCI deployments that exceed the following specifications are not supported:

| Resource                     | Maximum |
| ---------------------------- | --------|
| Physical servers per cluster | 16      |
| VMs per host                 | 1,024   |
| Disks per VM (SCSI)          | 256     |
| Storage per cluster          | 4 PB    |
| Storage per server           | 400 TB  |
| Volumes per cluster          | 64      |
| Volume size                  | 64 TB   |
| Logical processors per host  | 512     |
| RAM per host                 | 24 TB   |
| RAM per VM                   | 12 TB (generation 2 VM) or 1 TB (generation 1)|
| Virtual processors per host  | 2,048   |
| Virtual processors per VM    | 240 (generation 2 VM) or 64 (generation 1)|-->

## Hardware requirements

In addition to Microsoft Azure Stack HCI updates, many OEMs also release regular updates for your Azure Stack HCI hardware, such as driver and firmware updates. To ensure that OEM package update notifications, reach your organization check with your OEM about their specific notification process.

Before deploying Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2, ensure that your hardware is up to date by:

- Determining the current version of your Solution Builder Extension (SBE) package.
- Finding the best method to download, install, and update your SBE package.

### BIOS setting

Check with your OEM regarding the necessary generic BIOS settings for Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2. These settings may include hardware virtualization, TPM enabled, and secure core.

## Driver

Check with your OEM regarding the necessary drivers that need to be installed for Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2. Additionally, your OEM can provide you with their preferred installation steps.

### Driver installation steps

You should always follow the OEM's recommended installation steps. If the OEM's guidance isn't available, see the following steps:

1. Identify the **Ethernet** using this command:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter
    ```

    Here's a sample output:

    ```console
    PS C:\Windows\system32>	get-netadapter
    
    Name	                      InterfaceDescription	                iflndex     Status	     MacAddress	            LinkSpeed

    ```

2. Identify the **DriverFileName**, **DriverVersion**, **DriverDate**, **DriverDescription**, and the **DriverProvider** using this command:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter -name ethernet | select *driver*
    ```

    Here's a sample output:

    ```console
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-NetAdapter -name ethernet | select *driver*

    DriverInformation		: Driver Date 2021-07-08 Version 2.70.24728.0 NDIS 6.85
    DriverFileName			: mlx5.sys
    DriverVersion			: 2.70.24728.0
    DriverDate			    : 2021-07-08
    DriverDateData			: 132701760000000000
    DriverDescription		: HPE Ethernet 10/25Gb 2-port 640FLR-SFP28 Adapter
    DriverMajorNdisVersion	: 6
    DriverMinorNdisVersion 	: 85
    DriverName			    : \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\mlx5.sys
    DriverProvider			: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
    DriverVersionString		: 2.70.24728.0
    MajorDriverVersion		: 2
    MinorDriverVersion		: 0
    ```

3. Search for your driver and the recommended installation steps.

4. Download your driver.

5. Install the driver identified in Step #2 by **DriverFileName** on all servers of the cluster. For more information, see [PnPUtil Examples - Windows Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/pnputil-examples#add-driver).

    Here's an example:

    ```powershell
    pnputil /add-driver mlx5.inf /install
    ```

6. Check to be sure the drivers are updated by reviewing **DriverVersion** and **DriverDate**.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapter -name ethernet | select *driver*
    ```

     Here's are some sample outputs:

    ```console
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-NetAdapter -name ethernet | select *driver*

    DriverInformation		: Driver Date 2023-05-03 Version 23.4.26054.0 NDIS 6.85
    DriverFileName			: mlx5.sys
    DriverVersion			: 23.4.26054.0
    DriverDate			    : 2023-05-03
    DriverDateData			: 133275456000000000

    DriverMajorNdisVersion	: 6
    DriverMinorNdisVersion 	: 85
    DriverName			    : \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\mlx5.sys
    DriverProvider			: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
    DriverVersionString		: 23.4.26054.0
    MajorDriverVersion		: 2
    MinorDriverVersion		: 0
    ```

    ```console
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-NetAdapter "ethernet 2" | select *driver*

    DriverInformation		: Driver Date 2023-05-03 Version 23.4.26054.0 NDIS 6.85
