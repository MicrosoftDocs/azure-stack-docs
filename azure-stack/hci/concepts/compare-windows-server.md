# Compare Azure Stack HCI to Windows Server

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2; Windows Server 2022

This article explains key differences between Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server and provides guidance about when to use each. Both products are actively supported and maintained by Microsoft. Many organizations choose to deploy both as they are intended for different and complementary purposes.

## When to use Azure Stack HCI

Azure Stack HCI is Microsoft's premier hyperconverged infrastructure platform for running VMs or virtual desktops on-premises with connections to Azure hybrid services. Azure Stack HCI can help to modernize and secure your datacenters and branch offices, and achieve industry-best performance with low latency and data sovereignty.

Use Azure Stack HCI for:

- The best virtualization host to modernize your infrastructure, either for existing workloads in your core datacenter or emerging requirements for branch office and edge locations.
- Easy extensibility to the cloud, with a regular stream of innovations from your Azure subscription and a consistent set of tools and experiences.
- All the benefits of hyperconverged infrastructure: a simpler, more consolidated datacenter architecture with high-speed storage and networking.

  >[!NOTE]
  > When using Azure Stack HCI, run all of your workloads inside virtual machines or containers, not directly on the cluster. Azure Stack HCI isn't licensed for clients to connect directly to it using Client Access Licenses (CALs).

For information about licensing Windows Server VMs running on an Azure Stack HCI cluster, see [Activate Windows Server VMs](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation).

## When to use Windows Server

Windows Server is a highly versatile, multi-purpose operating system with dozens of roles and hundreds of features and includes the right for clients to connect directly with appropriate CALs. Windows Server machines can be in the cloud or on-premises, including virtualized on top of Azure Stack HCI.

Use Windows Server for:

- A guest operating system inside of virtual machines (VMs) or containers
- As the runtime server for a Windows application
- To use one or more of the built-in server roles such as Active Directory, file services, DNS, DHCP, or Internet Information Services (IIS)
- As a traditional server, such as a bare-metal domain controller or SQL Server installation
- For traditional infrastructure, such as VMs connected to Fibre Channel SAN storage
