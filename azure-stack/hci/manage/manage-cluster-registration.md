# Manage Azure Stack HCI cluster registration

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2.md)]

Depending on your cluster configuration and requirements, you may need to take additional steps after registering your cluster with Azure. This article describes how to manage your cluster registration using Windows Admin Center, PowerShell, or the Azure portal. It also provides answers to the frequently asked questions about cluster registration.

When you [register your cluster with Azure](../deploy/register-with-azure.md), an Azure Resource Manager resource is created to represent the on-premises Azure Stack HCI cluster. Starting with Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2, registering a cluster automatically creates an Azure Arc of the server resource for each server in the Azure Stack HCI cluster. This Azure Arc integration extends the Azure management plane to Azure Stack HCI. The Azure Arc integration enables periodic syncing of information between the Azure resource and the on-premises clusters.

## View registration and Arc-enabled servers status

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

When you connect to a cluster using Windows Admin Center, you'll see the dashboard, which displays the Azure Stack HCI registration and Arc-enabled servers status.

- For Azure Stack HCI registration, **Connected** means that the cluster is already registered with Azure and has successfully synced to the cloud within the last day.
- For Arc-enabled servers, **Connected** means that all physical servers are Arc-enabled and can be managed from the Azure portal.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/dashboard-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the cluster connection status on the Windows Admin Center dashboard." lightbox="media/register-with-azure/dashboard-connected.png":::

You can get more information by selecting **Azure Arc** from the **Tools** menu on the left.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Arc dashboard is currently in public preview.

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/overview-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selections for getting Azure Stack HCI registration information." lightbox="media/register-with-azure/overview-connected.png":::

On the **Overview** page, you will find high-level status information about Azure Stack HCI registration and Arc-enabled servers. You can click on either tile to be taken to the individual pages.

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/hci-registration-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of status information about registration." lightbox="media/register-with-azure/hci-registration-connected.png":::

On the **Azure Stack HCI registration** page, you can view both the Azure Stack HCI system and server status. This includes the Azure connection status and last Azure sync. You can find **Useful links** to troubleshooting documentation and cluster extensions. You can **Unregister** if needed.

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/arc-enabled-servers-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of servers status." lightbox="media/register-with-azure/arc-enabled-servers-connected.png":::

If your cluster is registered with Azure, but the physical servers are not yet Arc-enabled, you can do so from the **Arc-enabled servers** page. If the physical servers are Arc-enabled, you can view the Azure Arc status and version ID for each server. You can also find **Useful links** to troubleshooting information.

# [PowerShell](#tab/power-shell)

Use the `Get-AzureStackHCI` PowerShell cmdlet to view the registration status, cluster status, and connection status properties.

For example, after you install the Azure Stack HCI operating system, but before you create or join a cluster, the `ClusterStatus` property shows a `NotYet` status:

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/1-get-azurestackhci.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure registration status before cluster creation.":::

After the cluster is created, only `RegistrationStatus` shows a `NotYet` status:

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/2-get-azurestackhci.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure registration status after cluster creation.":::

You must register an Azure Stack HCI cluster within 30 days of installation, as defined in the Azure Online Services Terms. If you haven't created or joined a cluster after 30 days, `ClusterStatus` will show `OutOfPolicy`. If you haven't registered the cluster after 30 days, `RegistrationStatus` will show `OutOfPolicy`.

After the cluster is registered, you can see `ConnectionStatus` and the `LastConnected` time. The `LastConnected` time is usually within the last day unless the cluster is temporarily disconnected from the internet. An Azure Stack HCI cluster can operate fully offline for up to 30 consecutive days.

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/3-get-azurestackhci.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure registration status after registration.":::

If you exceed the maximum period of offline operation, `ConnectionStatus` will show `OutOfPolicy`.

> [!NOTE]
> BIOS\UEFI Firmware configuration must be the same on each HCI cluster node's hardware. Any nodes with different BIOS configurations compared to the majority may show **ConnectionStatus** as **OutOfPolicy**.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To view the status of the cluster and Arc resources, navigate to the resource group used during registration in the Azure portal:

:::image type="content" source="media/register-with-azure/cluster-status-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of cluster resources." lightbox="media/register-with-azure/cluster-status-1.png":::

## Enable Azure Arc integration

Starting with Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2, the clusters are automatically Arc-enabled on registration. Azure Arc integration isn't available on Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2.

You need to manually enable Azure Arc integration in the following scenarios:

- You updated your cluster servers from Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2 (which were previously not Arc-enabled manually) to version 21H2.
- If you have previously Arc-enabled your 20H2 clusters, and after upgrading to 21H2 the Arc enablement is still failing, [see the guidance here to troubleshoot](../deploy/troubleshoot-hci-registration.md#registration-completes-successfully-but-azure-arc-connection-in-portal-says-not-installed).
- You disabled Arc enablement previously, and now you intend to Arc-enable your 21H2 or later Azure Stack HCI cluster.

Follow these steps to enable Azure Arc integration:

1. Install the latest version of the `Az.StackHCI` module on your management PC:

   ```PowerShell
   Install-Module -Name Az.StackHCI
   ```

1. Rerun the `Register-AzStackHCI` cmdlet and specify your Azure subscription ID, which must be the same ID with which the cluster was originally registered. The `-ComputerName` parameter can be the name of any server in the cluster. This step enables Azure Arc integration on every server in the cluster. It will not affect your current cluster registration with Azure, and you don't need to unregister the cluster first:

   ```PowerShell
   Register-AzStackHCI  -SubscriptionId "<subscription_ID>" -ComputerName Server1 -Region <region> -TenantId "<tenant_id>"
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the cluster was originally registered using a `-Region`, `-ResourceName`, or `-ResourceGroupName` that's different from the default settings, you must specify those same parameters and values here. Running `Get-AzureStackHCI` will display these values.

For failures while enabling Arc, [see the guidance here for troubleshooting](../deploy/troubleshoot-hci-registration.md#registration-completes-successfully-but-azure-arc-connection-in-portal-says-not-installed).

## Upgrade Arc agent on cluster servers

Starting with Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2, to automatically update the Arc agent when a new version is available, make sure the cluster servers are configured with Microsoft Update. For more information, see [Microsoft Update configuration](/azure/azure-arc/servers/manage-agent#windows-agent).

Follow these steps to upgrade Arc agent on cluster servers:

1. In the [Server Configuration Tool (SConfig)](/windows-server/administration/server-core/server-core-sconfig), select the option to **Install Updates** (option 6):

   :::image type="content" source="media/register/sconfig-install.png" alt-text="Screenshot of SConfig showing the option to install update.":::

2. Select the option for **All quality updates** (option 1).

3. You can choose to specifically update the Arc agent, or install all of the updates available:

   :::image type="content" source="media/register/sconfig-updates.png" alt-text="Sconfig options":::

4. Run `azcmagent version` from PowerShell on each node to verify the Arc agent version.

## Unregister Azure Stack HCI

You can unregister Azure Stack HCI using Windows Admin Center or using PowerShell.

The unregistration process automatically cleans up the Azure resource that represents the cluster, the Azure resource group (if the group was created during registration and doesn't contain any other resources), and the Azure AD app identity. This cleanup stops all monitoring, support, and billing functionality through Azure Arc.

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

Follow these steps to unregister your Azure Stack HCI cluster via Windows Admin Center:

1. Connect to the cluster using Windows Admin Center.

1. Select **Azure Arc** from the menu on the left-hand side.

1. Select **Azure Stack HCI registration**, select the **Unregister** button, and then select **Unregister** again.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Windows Admin Center gateway is registered to a different Azure AD tenant ID that was used to initially register the cluster, you might encounter problems when you try to unregister the cluster using Windows Admin Center. If this happens, you can use the PowerShell instructions in the next section.

# [PowerShell](#tab/power-shell)

You can use the [`Unregister-AzStackHCI`](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/unregister-azstackhci) cmdlet to unregister an Azure Stack HCI cluster with PowerShell.

You might need to install the latest version of the **Az.StackHCI** module. If you see a prompt that says **Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?**, answer yes (Y):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.StackHCI
```

### Unregister from cluster-node

Use the [`Unregister-AzStackHCI`](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/unregister-azstackhci) with the `subscriptionID` and `TenantID` parameters to unregister a cluster directly from a cluster node:

```powershell
Unregister-AzStackHCI -SubscriptionId "<subscription ID GUID>" -TenantID "<tenant_id>"
```

### Unregister from a management PC

Use the [`Unregister-AzStackHCI`](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/unregister-azstackhci) cmdlet with the `subscriptionID`, `TenantID` and `ComputerName` parameters to unregister a cluster from a management PC:

```powershell
Unregister-AzStackHCI -ComputerName ClusterNode1 -SubscriptionId "<subscription_ID>" -TenantId "<tenant_id>"
```

If the management PC has a GUI, you will get a login prompt, in which you provide the credentials to access the cluster node. If the management PC doesn't have a GUI, use the `-credentials <credentials to log in to cluster nodes>` parameter in the `Unregister-AzStackHCI` cmdlet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're unregistering the Azure Stack HCI cluster in Azure China, run the `Unregister-AzStackHCI` cmdlet with these additional parameters:
>
> `-EnvironmentName AzureChinaCloud -Region "ChinaEast2"`
>
> If you're unregistering in Azure Government, use these additional parameters:
>
> `-EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment -Region "USGovVirginia"`
>
> If you provide the `-SubscriptionId` parameter, make sure that it's the correct one. It's recommended that you let the unregister script determine the subscription automatically.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell to unregister your cluster.

## Clean up after a cluster that was not properly unregistered

If a user destroys an Azure Stack HCI cluster without un-registering it, such as by re-imaging the host servers or deleting virtual cluster nodes, then artifacts will be left over in Azure. These artifacts are harmless and won't incur billing or use resources, but they can clutter the Azure portal. To clean them up, you can manually delete them.

To delete the Azure Stack HCI resource, navigate to the resource in the Azure portal and select **Delete** from the action bar. You can get the resource details by running the `Get-AzureStackHCI` cmdlet.

Azure Stack HCI creates two Azure AD applications as part of the registration: **resourceName** and **resourceName.arc**. To delete those, go to **Azure AD** > **App Registrations** > **All Applications**. Select **Delete** and confirm.

You can also delete the Azure Stack HCI resource by using PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Remove-AzResource -ResourceId "<resource_name>"
```

You might need to install the `Az.Resources` module:

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name Az.Resources
```

If the resource group was created during registration and doesn't contain any other resources, you can delete it too:

```PowerShell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "<resourceGroupName>"
```

## FAQs

Find answers to some frequently asked questions:

### How do I use a more restricted custom permissions role?

You can further reduce the permissions required to perform Azure Stack HCI registration as described in [Assign Azure permissions using PowerShell](../deploy/register-with-azure.md#assign-azure-permissions-using-powershell), provided that some of the operations described below are already performed out-of-band by a user having contributor and user access administrator roles.

1. Register the required resource providers. Sign in to the subscription you will use to register the cluster. Under **Settings > Resource Providers**, select the following resource providers and then select **Register**:
   - Microsoft.AzureStackHCI
   - Microsoft.HybridCompute
   - Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
   - Microsoft.HybridConnectivity

2. Create the resource groups. Make sure the resource groups into which the Azure Stack HCI resources will be projected are pre-created by a privileged user. For more details, see the [prerequisites](../deploy/register-with-azure.md#prerequisites) section.

   Once these two pre-requisites are set up, create a custom role and use it for registration as described below. First, create a JSON file called **customHCIRole.json** with the following content. Make sure to change `<subscriptionID>` to the ID of your Azure subscription. To get your subscription ID, visit the Azure portal, go to **Subscriptions**, then copy/paste your ID from the list:

   ```json
   {
     "Name": "Azure Stack HCI registration role",
     "Id": null,
     "IsCustom": true,
     "Description": "Custom Azure role to allow subscription-level access to register Azure Stack HCI",
     "Actions": [
       "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
       "Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/clusters/*",
       "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write",
       "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read"
      ],
      "NotActions": [
      ],
      "AssignableScopes": [
         "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>"
      ]
   }
   ```

3. Create the custom role:

   ```powershell
   New-AzRoleDefinition -InputFile <path to customHCIRole.json>
   ```

4. Assign the custom role to the user:

   ```powershell
   $user = get-AzAdUser -DisplayName <userdisplayname>
   $role = Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name "Azure Stack HCI registration role"
   New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $user.Id -RoleDefinitionId $role.Id -Scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionid>
   ```

   You can now register the cluster using [Register-AzStackHCI](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/register-azstackhci).

   If you need to un-register this cluster, add the **Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete** permission to the JSON file when creating the custom role.

### How do I register a cluster using ArmAccessToken/SPN?

Before registration, make sure the [prerequisites](../deploy/register-with-azure.md#prerequisites) are met.

> [!NOTE]
> These SPN credentials are used for initial onboarding to Azure Stack HCI. Azure Stack HCI still creates separate SPN credentials for Arc onboarding. To use a custom SPN for Arc onboarding, see [How do I register a cluster using SPN for Arc onboarding?](#how-do-i-register-a-cluster-using-spn-for-arc-onboarding).

1. Run ['Connect-AzAccount'](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) to connect to Azure.
   To use SPN to connect, you can use:
   - Device Code-based authentication. Use `-DeviceCode` in the cmdlet.
   - Certificated based authentication. [See this article](/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication) to configure the SPN for certificate-based authentication. Then use appropriate parameters in the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet that accept certificate information.
   The SPN you use should have all the required permissions on the subscriptions [as listed here](../deploy/register-with-azure.md#assign-azure-permissions-for-registration).
1. Assign `$token = Get-AzAccessToken`.
1. Use the [Register-AzStackHCI](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/register-azstackhci) with the `TenantId`, `SubscriptionId`, `ArmAccessToken`, and `AccountId` parameters, as follows:

   ```powershell
   Register-AzStackHCI -TenantId "<tenant_ID>" -SubscriptionId "<subscription_ID>" -ComputerName Server1 -Region <region> -ArmAccessToken $token.Token -AccountId $token.UserId
   ```

### How do I register a cluster using SPN for Arc onboarding?

The following guidelines are for the user running the registration cmdlet who cannot get the **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission assigned. In such cases, they can use the pre-created SPN with Arc onboarding roles (**Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** and **Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator**) assigned to the SPN, and specify the credentials to the registration cmdlet using the `-ArcSpnCredential` option.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Stack HCI doesn't update the credentials of the SPN created in this way. When the SPN credentials are near expiry, you must regenerate the credentials and run the "repair registration" flow to update the SPN credentials on the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Use PowerShell module version 1.4.1 or earlier to use SPN credentials for Arc onboarding if you cannot assign the **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission to the registration role.

Before registration, make sure the prerequisites and pre-checks are met. The user registering the cluster has either the "contributor" role assigned for the subscription which is used for the cluster registration, or has the following list of permissions if a custom role is assigned:

- "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
- "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
- "Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/register/action",
- "Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/Unregister/Action",
- "Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/clusters/*",
- "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read",
- "Microsoft.HybridCompute/register/action",
- "Microsoft.GuestConfiguration/register/action",
- "Microsoft.HybridConnectivity/register/action"

For unregistration, make sure you also have **Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete** permission.

To register the cluster and Arc-enable the servers, run the following PowerShell commands after updating them with your environment information. The following commands require **Az.Resources** (minimum version 5.6.0) and **Az.Accounts** (minimum version 2.7.6). You can use the `get-installedModule <module name>` cmdlet to check the installed version of a PowerShell module.

```powershell
#Connect to subscription
Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <tenant_id> -SubscriptionId <Subscription_ID> -Scope Process

#Create a new application registration
$app = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName "<unique_name>"

#Create a new SPN corresponding to the application registration
$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId  $app.AppId -Role "Reader" 

#Roles required on SPN for Arc onboarding
$AzureConnectedMachineOnboardingRole = "Azure Connected Machine Onboarding"
$AzureConnectedMachineResourceAdministratorRole = "Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator"

#Assign roles to the created SPN
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $sp.Id -RoleDefinitionName $AzureConnectedMachineOnboardingRole | Out-Null
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $sp.Id -RoleDefinitionName $AzureConnectedMachineResourceAdministratorRole | Out-Null

# Set password validity time. SPN must be updated on the HCI cluster after this timeframe.
$pwdExpiryInYears = 300
$start = Get-Date
$end = $start.AddYears($pwdExpiryInYears)
$pw = New-AzADSpCredential -ObjectId $sp.Id -StartDate $start -EndDate $end
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString $pw.SecretText -AsPlainText -Force  

# Create SPN credentials object to be used in the register-azstackhci cmdlet
$spnCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($app.AppId, $password)
Disconnect-AzAccount -ErrorAction Ignore | Out-Null

# Use the SPN credentials created previously in the register-azstackhci cmdlet
Register-AzStackHCI -SubscriptionId < Subscription_ID> -Region <region> -ArcSpnCredential:$spnCred
```

### Is resource move supported for Azure Stack HCI resources?

We do not support resource move for any Azure Stack HCI resources. To change the location of the resources, you must [unregister](#unregister-azure-stack-hci) the cluster first, and then re-register it at the new location by passing the appropriate parameters in the [Register-AzStackHCI](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/register-azstackhci) cmdlet.

### What are some of the more commonly used registration and Arc cmdlets?

- For **Az.StackHCI** PowerShell module cmdlets, see the [HCI PowerShell documentation](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/).  
- **Get-AzureStackHCI**: returns the current node connection and policy information for Azure Stack HCI.
- **Get-AzureStackHCIArcIntegration**: returns the status of node Arc integration.
- **Sync-AzureStackHCI**:
  - Performs billing, licensing, and census sync with Azure.
  - The system runs this cmdlet automatically every 12 hours.
  - You should only use this cmdlet when a cluster's internet connection has been unavailable for an extended period.
  - Do not run this cmdlet immediately after server reboot; let the automatic sync happen. Otherwise, it may result in a bad state.
