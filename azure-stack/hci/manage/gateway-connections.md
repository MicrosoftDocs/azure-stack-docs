# Manage Azure Stack HCI gateway connections

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

In this topic, learn how to create, delete, and update gateway connections using Windows Admin Center after you deploy Software Defined Networking (SDN). Gateways are used for routing network traffic between a virtual network and another network, either local or remote. There are three types of gateway connections â€“ Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), and Layer 3 (L3).

> [!NOTE]
> You need to deploy SDN gateways before you can create a gateway connection. Additionally, you need to deploy Software Load Balancers (SLBs) before you can create an IPsec connection.

For more information on gateways for SDN, see [What is RAS Gateway for SDN](../concepts/gateway-overview.md). For more information on SDN deployment, see [Deploy an SDN infrastructure using SDN Express](sdn-express.md).

## Create a new IPsec gateway connection

IPsec gateway connections are used to provide secure site-to-site encrypted connections between SDN virtual networks and external customer networks over the internet.

:::image type="content" source="media/gateway/ipsec-connection.png" alt-text="SDN IPsec gateway connection" lightbox="media/gateway/ipsec-connection.png":::

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All Connections**, select the cluster you want to create the gateway connection on.
1. Under **Tools**, scroll down to **Networking**, and select **Gateway Connections**.
1. Under **Gateway Connections**, select the **Inventory** tab, then select **New**.
1. Under **Create a new Gateway Connection**, enter a name for the connection
1. Select a **Virtual Network** for which the gateway connection will be setup.
1. Set the **Connection Type** as **IPSEC**.
1. Select a gateway pool for the connection. By default, a gateway pool called "DefaultAll" is created. You can choose this or create a new gateway pool.
You can create a new gateway pool using the `New-NetworkControllerGatewayPool` PowerShell cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run directly on the Network Controller VMs or it can be run remotely with credentials.
1. Select a **Gateway Subnet**. This is a subnet in your virtual network that is used specifically for gateway connections. IP addresses from this subnet will be provisioned on the gateway VMs. If you do not have a gateway subnet configured, add it to the virtual network and then create the gateway connection. This subnet can be small, for example, with a /30, /29 or /28 prefix.
1. Provide a value for **Maximum Allowed Inbound bandwidth (KBPS)** and **Maximum Allowed Outbound bandwidth (KBPS)**. Ensure that you provide a value that is commensurate to the total capacity of the gateway. Total capacity is provided by you as part of the gateway deployment. To learn more about gateway capacity and how the IPsec connection bandwidth affects it, see [Gateway capacity calculation](/windows-server/networking/sdn/gateway-allocation#gateway-capacity-calculation).
1. Provide a **Destination IP** for the connection. This is the public IP address of your remote gateway.
1. Add **Routes** for your connection. Each route must have a **route metric** and a **destination subnet** prefix. Any packets destined to these subnet prefixes will go over the gateway connection.
1. Provide an **IPsec shared secret** for the connection. This must match the authentication type (preshared key) and shared secret configured on the remote gateway.
1. Provide IPsec advanced settings if needed.
1. Click **Create** to configure the connection.
1. In the **Gateway Connections** list, verify the configuration state of the connection is **Success**.

## Create a new GRE gateway connection

GRE-based tunnels enable connectivity between tenant virtual networks and external networks. Because the GRE protocol is lightweight and support for GRE is available on most network devices, it is an ideal choice for tunneling where encryption of data is not required.

:::image type="content" source="media/gateway/gre-connection.png" alt-text="SDN GRE gateway connection" lightbox="media/gateway/gre-connection.png":::

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All Connections**, select the cluster you want to create the gateway connection on.
1. Under **Tools**, scroll down to **Networking**, and select **Gateway Connections**.
1. Under **Gateway Connections**, select the **Inventory** tab, then select **New**.
1. Under **Create a new Gateway Connection**, enter a name for the connection.
1. Select a **Virtual Network** for which the gateway connection will be setup.
1. Set the **Connection Type** as **GRE**.
1. Select a gateway pool for the connection. By default, a gateway pool called "DefaultAll" is created. You can choose this or create a new gateway pool.
You can create a new gateway pool using the `New-NetworkControllerGatewayPool` PowerShell cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run directly on the Network Controller VMs or it can be run remotely with credentials.
1. Select a **Gateway Subnet**. This is a subnet in your virtual network that is used specifically for gateway connections. IP addresses from this subnet will be provisioned on the gateway VMs. If you do not have a gateway subnet configured, add it to the virtual network and then create the gateway connection. This subnet can be small, for example, with a /30, /29 or /28 prefix.
1. Provide a value for **Maximum Allowed Inbound bandwidth (KBPS)** and **Maximum Allowed Outbound bandwidth (KBPS)**. Ensure that you provide a value that is commensurate to the total capacity of the gateway. Total capacity is provided by you as part of the gateway deployment. To learn more about gateway capacity and how does GRE connection bandwidth affect it, see [Gateway capacity calculation](/windows-server/networking/sdn/gateway-allocation#gateway-capacity-calculation).
1. Provide a **Destination IP** for the connection. This is the public IP address of your remote gateway.
1. Add **Routes** for your connection. Each route must have a route metric and a destination subnet prefix. Any packets destined to these subnet prefixes will go over the gateway connection.
1. Provide a **GRE key** for the connection. This must match the GRE key configured on the remote gateway.
1. Click **Create** to configure the connection.
1. In the **Gateway Connections** list, verify the Configuration State of the connection is **Success**.

## Create an L3 connection

L3 forwarding enables connectivity between the physical infrastructure in the data center and the SDN virtual networks. Using an L3 forwarding connection, tenant network VMs can connect to a physical network through the SDN gateway. In this case, the SDN gateway acts as a router between the SDN virtual network and the physical network.

:::image type="content" source="media/gateway/l3-connection.png" alt-text="SDN L3 gateway connection" lightbox="media/gateway/l3-connection.png":::

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **All Connections**, select the cluster you want to create the gateway connection on.
1. Under **Tools**, scroll down to **Networking**, and select **Gateway Connections**.
1. Under **Gateway Connections**, select the **Inventory tab**, then select **New**.
1. Under **Create a new Gateway Connection**, enter a name for the connection.
1. Select a **Virtual Network** for which the gateway connection will be setup.
1. Set the **Connection Type** as **L3**.
1. Select a gateway pool for the connection. By default, a gateway pool called "DefaultAll" is created. You can choose this or create a new gateway pool.
You can also create a gateway pool using `New-NetworkControllerGatewayPool` PowerShell cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run directly on the Network Controller VMs or it can be run remotely with credentials.
1. Select a **Gateway Subnet**. This is a subnet in your virtual network that is used specifically for gateway connections. IP addresses from this subnet will be provisioned on the gateway VMs. If you do not have a gateway subnet configured, add it to the virtual network and then create the gateway connection. This subnet can be small, for example, with a /30, /29 or /28 prefix.
1. Provide a value for **Maximum Allowed Inbound bandwidth (KBPS)** and **Maximum Allowed Outbound bandwidth (KBPS)**. Ensure that you provide a value that is commensurate to the total capacity of the gateway. Total capacity is provided by you as part of the gateway deployment. To learn more about gateway capacity and how does L3 connection bandwidth affect it, see [Gateway capacity calculation](/windows-server/networking/sdn/gateway-allocation#gateway-capacity-calculation).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For L3 connections, maximum inbound and outbound bandwidth is not enforced. But the provided values are still used to reduce the available gateway capacity so that the gateway is not over or under provisioned.  

1. Add **Routes** for your connection. Each route must have a route metric and a destination subnet prefix. Any packets destined to these subnet prefixes will go over the gateway connection.
1. Select a network for the **L3 Logical Network**. This represents the physical network that wants to communicate with the virtual network. You must configure this network as an SDN logical network.
1. Select **L3 Logical Subnet** from the **L3 Logical Network**. Ensure that the subnet has a VLAN configured.
1. Provide an IP address for **L3 IP Address/Subnet Mask**. This must belong to the L3 Logical Subnet that you provided above. This IP address is configured on the SDN gateway interface. The IP address must be provided in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format.
1. Provide an **L3 Peer IP address**. This must belong to the L3 Logical Subnet that you provided above. This IP will serve as the next hop, once the traffic destined to the physical network from the virtual network reaches the SDN gateway.
1. Click **Create** to configure the connection.
1. In the **Gateway Connections** list, verify the Configuration State of the connection is **Success**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you plan to deploy L3 [Gateway connections](../manage/gateway-connections.md) with BGP routing, ensure that youâ€™ve configured the Top of Rack (ToR) switch BGP settings with the following:
    > - update-source: This specifies the source address for BGP updates, that is L3 VLAN. For example, VLAN 250.
    > - ebgp multihop: This specifies additional hops required since the BGP neighbor is more than one hop away.
