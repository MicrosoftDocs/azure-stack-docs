# Set up Azure Arc VM management using Windows Admin Center (preview)

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2

You can set up Azure Arc VM management using Windows Admin Center (recommended) or Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI).

This article describes how to use Windows Admin Center to set up Azure Arc VM management, which includes:

- [Setting up Windows Admin Center](#set-up-windows-admin-center)

- [Setting up Arc Resource Bridge and creating custom location](#set-up-arc-resource-bridge-and-create-custom-location)

- [Projecting virtual network and images](create-virtual-networks.md)

To set up Azure Arc VM management using command line, see [Set up Azure Arc VM management using command line](deploy-arc-resource-bridge-using-command-line.md).

For an overview of Azure Arc VM management, see [What is Azure Arc VM management?](azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to complete the [prerequisites for setting up Azure Arc VM management](azure-arc-vm-management-prerequisites.md).

## Set up Windows Admin Center

The deployment for Arc Resource Bridge is natively available as part of the Windows Admin Center MSI. For Azure Arc Resource Bridge deployment, you must install Windows Admin Center 2110.2 or later on a Windows 10 machine or on a server. You can check the version by clicking the question mark icon on the top right corner of the Windows Admin Center screen.

Also ensure that the latest version of the following extensions are installed:

- Azure Kubernetes Service

- Cluster Manager

These extensions come pre-installed with Windows Admin Center versions 2110.2 and later. To check the version of these extensions:

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **Tools** select **Settings**, then select **Extensions**.
1. On the **Installed Extensions** tab, find the **Azure Kubernetes Service** and **Cluster Manager** extensions and verify their versions.

## Set up Arc Resource Bridge and create custom location

To check all the prerequisites that should be met to deploy Arc Resource Bridge on an Azure Stack HCI Cluster, in Windows Admin Center select the **Settings** option on the lower left-hand side when connected to a cluster, and then navigate to **Azure Arc VM setup for Azure Stack HCI**.

If an Arc Resource Bridge is not detected, a button is displayed to deploy Resource Bridge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've already set up AKS-HCI on your Azure Stack HCI cluster, you cannot currently deploy Arc Resource Bridge using Windows Admin Center. Use the command line instructions instead for deploying [Arc Resource Bridge](deploy-arc-resource-bridge-using-command-line.md).

Perform the following steps to deploy Azure Arc Resource Bridge:

1. Select **Deploy Resource Bridge** to launch the setup wizard.

1. Review the prerequisites for the machine you're running Windows Admin Center on, the cluster you're connected to, and the network. Additionally, make sure you're signed into an Azure account on Windows Admin Center and that the Azure subscription you want to use is not expired. You must have the Owner role on your Azure subscription that you want to use. When finished reviewing the prerequisites, select **Next**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Make sure you configured at least one external virtual switch before proceeding further. Otherwise, you won't be able to successfully set up your Azure Kubernetes Service host.

1. On the **System validation** page of the wizard, take the required actions to connect Windows Admin Center gateway to the Azure Stack HCI cluster. As a result of validation, it will prompt you to install the required modules for deploying Arc Resource Bridge.

1. Ensure system connectivity through CredSSP in the Connectivity step. CredSSP lets Windows Admin Center delegate the user's credentials from the gateway to a target server for remote authentication. CredSSP needs to be enabled to set up Azure Kubernetes Service. After you enabled CredSSP, select **Next**.

1. Provide the configuration details for Arc Resource Bridge. This step of the wizard asks you to configure the following details:

    - **Host Details** such as name for the Resource Bridge and an image directory where VM images will be stored. The image directory must be on a Cluster Shared Volume available to all servers in the cluster.

    - **VM Networking** information for deploying Arc Resource Bridge appliance. These settings include the fields for the internet connected virtual switch, virtual LAN identification enablement, **Cloudagent IP** and **Control plane IP**. This section also provides an option to select the IP address allocation method for the Arc Resource Bridge VM.
    
        - The **Controlplane IP** address is used for the load balancer in the Arc Resource Bridge. This IP address needs to be in the same subnet as the DHCP scope for virtual machines and must be excluded from the DHCP scope to avoid IP address conflicts.
        
        - The **Cloudagent IP** address is required only for static IP configurations on the underlay network for the physical hosts.

        The following screenshot displays an example of a DHCP networking configuration:

        :::image type="content" source="media/manage-azure-arc-vm/networking-configuration.png" alt-text="[Screenshot that shows Networking configuration tab with DHCP option as selected":::

1. On the Azure Registration page of the wizard, provide the details about the subscription, resource group, and region you wish to use for this service. Your resource group will need to be in the East US or West Europe region.

    When finished, select **Review Settings**.

1. Review all of your selections in the **Review Settings** step. If you're satisfied with your selections, select, **Apply** to prepare the cluster hosts, and after completion of that step, proceed to **Deployment**.

1. On the **Deployment** page, you can watch the progress of the Arc Resource Bridge. At this point, you are welcome to open Windows Admin Center in a new tab and continue your management tasks. The deployment takes about 15-30 minutes to complete.

If the deployment is successful, the wizard automatically navigates to the Arc Resource Bridge dashboard. On this dashboard, you can see the details of the custom location and Arc Resource Bridge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even after successful deployment of the Azure Arc Resource Bridge, Windows Admin Center may not be able to detect the status of the Resource Bridge and may display an error instead of the dashboard. This error does not indicate any issues with your deployment and the operations conducted through the Azure portal should work normally.
