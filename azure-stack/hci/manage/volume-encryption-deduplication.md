# Enable volume encryption, deduplication, and compression in Azure Stack HCI

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019

This topic covers how to enable encryption with BitLocker on volumes in Azure Stack HCI using Windows Admin Center. It also covers how to enable deduplication and compression on volumes. To learn how to create volumes, see [Create volumes](create-volumes.md).

## Turn on BitLocker to protect volumes
To turn on BitLocker in Windows Admin Center:

1. Connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then on the **Tools** pane, select **Volumes**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > To use a new feature that provides an additional locally held BitLocker key and not rely on Active Directory, you must use Windows PowerShell. The new feature is only available in Windows Server 2022 and Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2. For more information, see [Use BitLocker with Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV)](/windows-server/failover-clustering/bitlocker-on-csv-in-ws-2022).

1. On the **Volumes** page, select the **Inventory** tab, select the appropriate volume, and then under **Optional features**, switch on the **Encryption (BitLocker)** toggle.

1. On the **Encryption (BitLocker)** pop-up, select **Start**, and then on the **Turn on Encryption** page, provide your credentials to complete the workflow.

   If the **Install BitLocker feature first** pop-up displays, follow its instructions to install the feature on each server in the cluster, and then restart your servers.

## Turn on deduplication and compression
Deduplication and compression are managed per volume. Deduplication and compression use a post-processing model, which means that you won't see savings until it runs. When it does, it will work over all files, even files that were there from before.

To turn on deduplication and compression on a volume in Windows Admin Center:

1. Connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then on the **Tools** pane, select **Volumes**.
1. On the **Volumes** page, select the **Inventory** tab.
1. In the list of volumes, select the name of the volume that you want to manage.
1. On the volume details page, switch on the **Deduplication and compression** toggle.
1. On the **Enable deduplication** pane, select the deduplication mode.

    Instead of complicated settings, Windows Admin Center lets you choose between ready-made profiles for different workloads. If you're not sure, use the default setting.

1. Select **Enable deduplication**.

Enabling volume encryption has a small impact on volume performance—typically under 10%, but the impact varies depending on your hardware and workloads. Data deduplication and compression also has an impact on performance—for details, see [Determine which workloads are candidates for Data Deduplication](/windows-server/storage/data-deduplication/install-enable#enable-dedup-candidate-workloads).

You're done! Repeat as needed to protect the data in your volumes.
