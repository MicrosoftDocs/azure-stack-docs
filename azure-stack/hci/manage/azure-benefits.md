# Azure Benefits on Azure Stack HCI

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2](../../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2.md)]

Microsoft Azure offers a range of differentiated workloads and capabilities that are designed to run only on Azure. Azure Stack HCI extends many of the same benefits you get from Azure, while running on the same familiar and high-performance on-premises or edge environments.

*Azure Benefits* makes it possible for supported Azure-exclusive workloads to work outside of the cloud. You can enable Azure Benefits on Azure Stack HCI at no extra cost. If you have Windows Server workloads, we recommend turning it on.

## How it works

This section is optional reading, and explains more about how Azure Benefits on HCI works "under the hood."

Azure Benefits relies on a built-in platform attestation service on Azure Stack HCI, and helps to provide assurance that VMs are indeed running on Azure environments.

This service is modeled after the same [IMDS Attestation](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service?tabs=windows#attested-data) service that runs in Azure, in order to enable some of the same workloads and benefits available to customers in Azure. Azure Benefits returns an almost identical payload. The main difference is that it runs on-premises, and therefore guarantees that VMs are running on Azure Stack HCI instead of Azure.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-benefits/cluster.png" alt-text="Architecture":::

Turning on Azure Benefits starts the service running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

1. On every server, HciSvc obtains a certificate from Azure, and securely stores it within an enclave on the server.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Certificates are renewed every time the Azure Stack HCI cluster syncs with Azure, and each renewal is valid for 30 days. As long as you maintain the usual 30 day connectivity requirements for Azure Stack HCI, no user action is required.

2. HciSvc exposes a private and non-routable REST endpoint, accessible only to VMs on the same server. To enable this endpoint, an internal vSwitch is configured on the Azure Stack HCI host (named *AZSHCI_HOST-IMDS_DO_NOT_MODIFY*). VMs then must have a NIC configured and attached to the same vSwitch (*AZSHCI_GUEST-IMDS_DO_NOT_MODIFY*).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Modifying or deleting this switch and NIC prevents Azure Benefits from working properly. If errors occur, disable Azure Benefits using Windows Admin Center or the PowerShell instructions that follow, and then try again.

3. Consumer workloads (for example, Windows Server Azure Edition guests) request attestation. HciSvc then signs the response with an Azure certificate.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must manually enable access for each VM that needs Azure Benefits.

## Enable Azure Benefits

Before you begin, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- An Azure Stack HCI cluster:
  - [Install updates](../manage/update-cluster.md): Version 21H2, with at least the December 14, 2021 security update KB5008223 or later.
  - [Register Azure Stack HCI](../deploy/register-with-azure.md?tab=windows-admin-center#register-a-cluster): All servers must be online and registered to Azure.
  - [Install Hyper-V and RSAT-Hyper-V-Tools](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server).

- If you are using Windows Admin Center:
  - Windows Admin Center (version 2103 or later) with Cluster Manager extension (version 2.41.0 or later).

You can enable Azure Benefits on Azure Stack HCI using either Windows Admin Center or PowerShell. The following sections describe each option.

## Option 1: Turn on Azure Benefits using Windows Admin Center

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-benefits/manage-benefits.gif" alt-text="Manage Benefits in WAC":::

1. In Windows Admin Center, select **Cluster Manager** from the top drop-down menu, navigate to the cluster that you want to activate, then under **Settings**, select **Azure Benefits**.

2. In the **Azure Benefits** pane, select **Turn on**. By default, the checkbox to turn on for all existing VMs is selected. You can deselect it and manually add VMs later.

3. Select **Turn on** again to confirm setup. It may take a few minutes for servers to reflect the changes.

4. When Azure Benefits setup is successful, the page updates to show the Azure Benefits dashboard. To check Azure Benefits for the host:
   1. Check that **Azure Benefits cluster status** appears as **On**.
   2. Under the **Cluster** tab in the dashboard, check that Azure Benefits for every server shows as **Active** in the table.

5. To check access to Azure Benefits for VMs: Check the status for VMs with Azure Benefits turned on. It's recommended that all of your existing VMs have Azure Benefits turned on; for example, 3 out of 3 VMs.

### Manage access to Azure Benefits for your VMs - WAC

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-benefits/manage-benefits-2.gif" alt-text="Manage Benefits for VMs":::

To turn on Azure Benefits for VMs, select the **VMs** tab, then select the VM(s) in the top table **VMs without Azure Benefits**, and then select **Turn on Azure Benefits for VMs.**

### Troubleshooting - WAC

- To turn off and reset Azure Benefits on your cluster:
  - Under the **Cluster** tab, click **Turn off Azure Benefits**.
- To remove access to Azure Benefits for VMs:
  - Under the **VM** tab, select the VM(s) in the top table **VMs without Azure Benefits**, and then click **Turn on Azure Benefits for VMs**.
- Under the **Cluster** tab, one or more servers appear as **Expired**:
  - If Azure Benefits for one or more servers has not synced with Azure for more than 30 days, it appears as **Expired** or **Inactive**. Select **Sync with Azure** to schedule a manual sync.
- Under the **VM** tab, host server benefits appear as **Unknown** or **Inactive**:
  - You will not be able to add or remove Azure Benefits for VMs on these host servers. Go to the **Cluster** tab to fix Azure Benefits for host servers with errors, then try and manage VMs again.

## Option 2: turn on Azure Benefits using PowerShell

1. To set up Azure Benefits, run the following command from an elevated PowerShell window on your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

   ```powershell
   Enable-AzStackHCIAttestation
   ```

   Or, if you want to add all existing VMs on setup, you can run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Enable-AzStackHCIAttestation -AddVM
   ```

2. When Azure Benefits setup is successful, you can view the Azure Benefits status. Check the cluster property **IMDS Attestation** by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureStackHCI
   ```

   Or, to view Azure Benefits status for servers, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureStackHCIAttestation [[-ComputerName] <string>]
   ```

3. To check access to Azure Benefits for VMs, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzStackHCIVMAttestation
   ```

### Manage access to Azure Benefits for your VMs - PowerShell

- To turn on benefits for selected VMs, run the following command on your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

   ```powershell
   Add-AzStackHCIVMAttestation [-VMName]
   ```

  Or, to add all existing VMs, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Add-AzStackHCIVMAttestation -AddAll
   ```

### Troubleshooting - PowerShell

- To turn off and reset Azure Benefits on your cluster, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Disable-AzStackHCIAttestation -RemoveVM
  ```

- To remove access to Azure Benefits for selected VMs:

  ```powershell
  Remove-AzStackHCIVMAttestation -VMName <string>
  ```

  Or, to remove access for all existing VMs:

  ```powershell
  Remove-AzStackHCIVMAttestation -RemoveAll
  ```

- If Azure Benefits for one or more servers is not yet synced and renewed with Azure, it may appear as **Expired** or **Inactive**. Schedule a manual sync:

  ```powershell
  Sync-AzureStackHCI
  ```

- If a server is newly added and has not yet been set up with Azure Benefits, it may appear as **Inactive**. To add the new server, run setup again:

  ```powershell
  Enable-AzStackHCIAttestation
  ```

## (Optional) View Azure Benefits using the Azure portal

1. In your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page, navigate to the **Configuration** tab.
2. Under the feature **Enable Azure Benefits**, view the host attestation status:

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-benefits/attestation-status.png" alt-text="Attestation status":::

## (Optional) Access Azure Benefits from VMs

To check that VMs can properly access Azure Benefits on the host, you can run this command from the VM and confirm that there is a response:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"Metadata"="true"} -Method GET -Uri "http://169.254.169.253:80/metadata/attested/document?api-version=2018-10-01"
```

## FAQ

This FAQ provides answers to some questions about using Azure Benefits.

### What Azure-exclusive workloads can I enable with Azure Benefits?

See the [full list here](#azure-benefits-available-on-azure-stack-hci).

### Does it cost anything to turn on Azure Benefits?

No, turning on Azure Benefits incurs no extra fees.

### Can I use Azure Benefits on environments other than Azure Stack HCI?

No, Azure Benefits is a feature built into the Azure Stack HCI OS, and can only be used on Azure Stack HCI.

### I have just set up Azure Benefits on my cluster. How do I ensure that Azure Benefits stays active?

- In most cases, there is no user action required. Azure Stack HCI automatically renews Azure Benefits when it syncs with Azure.
- However, if the cluster disconnects for more than 30 days and Azure Benefits shows as **Expired**, you can manually sync using PowerShell and Windows Admin Center. For more information, see [syncing Azure Stack HCI](../faq.yml#what-happens-if-the-30-day-limit-is-exceeded).

### What happens when I deploy new VMs, or delete VMs?

- When you deploy new VMs that require Azure Benefits, you can manually add new VMs to access Azure Benefits using Windows Admin Center or PowerShell, using the preceding instructions.
- You can still delete and migrate VMs as usual. The NIC **AZSHCI_GUEST-IMDS_DO_NOT_MODIFY** will still exist on the VM after migration. To clean up the NIC before migration, you can remove VMs from Azure Benefits using Windows Admin Center or PowerShell using the preceding instructions, or you can migrate first and manually delete NICs afterwards.

### What happens when I add or remove servers?

- When you add a server, you can navigate to the **Azure Benefits** page in Windows Admin Center, and a banner will appear with a link to **Enable inactive server**.
- Or, you can run `Enable-AzStackHCIAttestation [[-ComputerName] <String>]` in PowerShell.
- You can still delete servers or remove them from the cluster as usual. The vSwitch **AZSHCI_HOST-IMDS_DO_NOT_MODIFY** will still exist on the server after removal from the cluster. You can leave it if you are planning to add the server back to the cluster later, or you can remove it manually.
