# Analyse Azure Stack HCI metrics with Azure Monitor Metrics (preview)

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 (preview)

This article explains how to use Azure Monitor Metrics to analyse monitoring data generated by Azure Stack HCI, including how to set up metric alerts to monitor your cluster. It also provides a comprehensive list of metrics collected for compute, storage, and network resources in Azure Stack HCI.

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, it's important to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. Azure Monitor is a full-stack monitoring service that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources. The Azure Monitor data platform is made up of Metrics and Logs. Each feature collects different kinds of data and enables different Azure Monitor features.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## What is Azure Monitor Metrics?

[Azure Monitor Metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics) stores numeric data from monitored resources, such as Azure Stack HCI clusters into a time-series database. The metric database is automatically created for each Azure subscription. Use [metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/tutorial-metrics)to analyze data from Azure Monitor Metrics.

## Benefits

Here are the benefits of using Azure Monitor Metrics for Azure Stack HCI:

- **No additional cost**. These metrics are standard, out-of-the-box features that are automatically collected and provided to you at no extra cost.

- **Near real-time insights**. You have the capability to observe out-of-the-box metrics and correlate trends using near real-time data.  

- **Customization**. You can create your own graphs and customize them through aggregation and filter functionality. The task of saving and sharing your metric charts via Excel, workbooks, or sending them to Grafana is straightforward.

- **Custom alert rules**. You can write custom alert rules on the metrics to efficiently monitor the health of your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

## Prerequisites

Here are the prerequisites of using Azure Monitor Metrics for Azure Stack HCI:

- The `TelemetryAndDiagnostics` extension must be installed to collect telemetry and diagnostics information from your Azure Stack HCI system. For more information about the extension, see [Azure Stack HCI telemetry and diagnostics extension overview    (preview)](../concepts/telemetry-and-diagnostics-overview.md).

- Your cluster must be running Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 (preview) (Build version: 2308) or later.

## Analyze metrics

You can use [metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts) to interactively analyze the data in your metric database and chart the values of multiple metrics over time. To open the metrics explorer in the Azure portal, select **Metrics** under the **Monitoring** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/analyse-metrics/monitor-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Select a scope pane." lightbox="media/analyse-metrics/monitor-metrics.png":::

You can also access **Metrics** directly from the menu for the Azure Stack HCI services.

:::image type="content" source="media/analyse-metrics/metrics-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Metrics page." lightbox="media/analyse-metrics/metrics-page.png":::

With **Metrics**, you can create charts from metric values and visually correlate trends. You can also create a metric alert rule or pin a chart to an Azure dashboard to view them with other visualizations. For a tutorial on using this tool, see [Analyze metrics for an Azure resource](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/tutorial-metrics).

Platform metrics are stored for 93 days, however, you can only query (in the **Metrics** tile) for a maximum of 30 days' worth of data on any single chart. To know more about data retention, see [Metrics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#platform-and-custom-metrics).

## Create metrics alerts

A metric alert rule monitors a resource by evaluating conditions on the resource metrics at regular intervals. If the conditions are met, an alert is fired. A metric time-series is a series of metric values captured over a period of time. You can use these metrics to create alert rules.

To learn more about metric alerts and how to create alert rules, see [Metric alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts) and [Create Azure Monitor alert rules](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule?tabs=metric).

You can create metric alerts for your Azure Stack HCI cluster through metrics explorer in the Azure portal or command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Create alerts through metrics explorer

Follow these steps to create alerts through metrics explorer:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Metrics** under the **Monitoring** section.

1. Select **Scope** and then select **Metric Namespace** as **Azure Stack HCI**.

1. Select the **Metric** on which you want to set up alerts.

1. Select **New alert rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/analyse-metrics/new-alert-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the option to create a new alert rule." lightbox="media/analyse-metrics/new-alert-rule.png":::

1. Select the signal name and then select **Apply**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/analyse-metrics/select-a-signal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Select a signal pane on the right." lightbox="media/analyse-metrics/select-a-signal.png":::

1. Preview the results of the selected metric signal in the **Preview** section. Select values for the **Time range** and **Time series**.

1. In the **Alert logic** section, add details like threshold, operator, aggregation type, threshold values, unit, threshold sensitivity, aggregation granularity, and frequency of evaluation and then select **Next: Actions \>**.

### Create alerts through Azure CLI

Use the [`az monitor metrics alert create`](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics/alert?view=azure-cli-latest#az-monitor-metrics-alert-create) command to create metrics alert rules through Azure CLI.

Here's an example of the command usage:

To create a metric alert rule that monitors if the average percentage CPU on a VM is greater than 90, run the following command:

```azure CLI
az monitor metrics alert create -n {nameofthealert} -g {ResourceGroup} --scopes {VirtualMachineResourceID} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 90" --description {descriptionofthealert}
```

### Analyze metrics and create alerts for a specific cluster

Follow these steps to analyze metrics and create alerts for a specific Azure Stack HCI cluster in the Azure portal:

1. Go to your Azure Stack HCI cluster and navigate to the **Monitoring** section.

1. To analyze metrics, select the **Metrics** option. Your cluster will already be populated in the scope section. Select the metric you want to analyze.

    :::image type="content" source="media/analyse-metrics/cluster-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the metrics for your cluster." lightbox="media/analyse-metrics/cluster-metrics.png":::

1. To create alerts, select the **Alerts** option and set up alert as described in [Create alerts through metrics explorer](#next-steps).
