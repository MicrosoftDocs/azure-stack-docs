# VM provisioning through Azure portal on Azure Stack HCI (preview)

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2

Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2 customers can use Azure portal to provision and manage on-premises Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) running on Azure Stack HCI clusters. With [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/), IT administrators can delegate permissions and roles to app owners and DevOps teams to enable self-service VM management for their Azure Stack HCI clusters through the Azure cloud control plane. Using [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) templates, VM provisioning can be easily automated in a secure cloud environment.
