# Collect diagnostic logs for Azure Stack HCI

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to collect diagnostic logs and send them to Microsoft to help identify and fix any issues with your Azure Stack HCI solution.

## On-demand log collection

On-demand log collection involves manually collecting and sending diagnostic logs to Microsoft using the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet from any node within the Azure Stack HCI cluster. When you run this cmdlet, the logs are temporarily copied locally. This copy is parsed, sent to Microsoft, and then deleted from your system. Microsoft retains this diagnostic data for up to 30 days and handles it as per the [standard privacy practices](https://privacy.microsoft.com/).

### When to use on-demand log collection

Here are the scenarios in which you can perform on-demand log collection:

- Microsoft Support requests for logs based on an open case.
- Logs are collected when a cluster is connected and registered.
- Logs are collected when the Observability components are operational and installed.
- Logs are collected when a cluster is only partly registered.
- Logs are collected for issues not related to registration failures.

To explore additional log collection methods in Azure Stack HCI and understand when to use them, see [Diagnostics](../concepts/observability.md#diagnostics).

## Prerequisites

Before you collect on-demand logs, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- You must have access to an Azure Stack HCI cluster.
- You must have access to Azure.
- You must have installed the `AzureEdgeTelemetryAndDiagnostics` extension to collect telemetry and diagnostics information from your Azure Stack HCI system. For information about the extension, see [Azure Stack HCI telemetry and diagnostics extension overview](../concepts/telemetry-and-diagnostics-overview.md).

## Perform on-demand log collection via PowerShell

You can perform on-demand log collection using PowerShell, the recommended method, or Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal, as described later in this article.

Run the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet from any node on your Azure Stack HCI cluster to perform on-demand log collection.

Here are some important points to consider:

- The completion time of the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet varies depending on factors, such as the roles for which logs are being collected, time duration specified, and the number of nodes in your Azure Stack HCI environment.
- If you don't specify any parameters, the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet collects data from all nodes for the previous one-hour duration.

Here's the syntax of `Send-DiagnosticData`:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [[-FilterByRole] <string[]>] [[-FromDate] <datetime>] [[-ToDate] <datetime>] [[-CollectSddc] <bool>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

For reference information on `Send-DiagnosticData`, see the [`Send-DiagnosticData` command reference](#send-diagnosticdata-command-reference) section later in this article.

## Examples and sample outputs

Here are some example commands with sample outputs that show how to use the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet with different parameters.

### Send diagnostics data with date filtering

In this example, you send diagnostics data with date filtering for log files for the past two hours:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData -FromDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-2) -ToDate (Get-Date)
```

Here's a sample output of this command:

```output
PS C:\CloudDeployment\logs> Send-DiagnosticData -FromDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-2) -ToDate (Get-Date)
Converting FromDate and ToDate to UTC
FromDate in UTC is now 12/04/2023 19:14:18. ToDate in UTC is now 12/04/2023 21:14:18
The correlation Id is <Correlation-ID>. This is used to query for this log collection in the diagnostic pipeline.
Provide the below information to the customer support engineer working on your case.
AEORegion: eastus
AEODeviceARMResourceUri: /Subscriptions/<Subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/EDGECI-REGISTRATION/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/clusters/<cluster-name>

==== CUT ==================== CUT =======
Log collection ended with status: Succeeded
PS C:\CloudDeployment\logs>   
```

### Send diagnostic data for specified roles

In this example, you send diagnostic data with role filtering for BareMetal and ECE:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData -FilterByRole BareMetal, ECE –CollectSddc $false
```

Here's a sample output of this command:

```output
PS C:\Users\docsuser> Send-DiagnosticData -FilterByRole BareMetal, ECE –CollectSddc $false
FromDate parameter not specified. Setting to default value 12/04/2023 20:41:21
ToDate parameter not specified. Setting to default value 12/04/2023 21:41:21
Converting FromDate and ToDate to UTC
FromDate in UTC is now 12/04/2023 20:41:21. ToDate in UTC is now 12/04/2023 21:41:21
The correlation Id is <Correlation-ID>. This is used to query for this log collection in the diagnostic pipeline.
Provide the below information to the customer support engineer working on your case.

==== CUT ==================== CUT =======
Log collection ended with status: Succeeded
PS C:\Users\docsuser>  
```

### Get a history of log collection

You can get a history of all the log collections that you have performed. This history helps you learn about the kinds of log collections, the sizes of log collections, the times when logs were collected, and the methods of log collection.

To get a history of log collections for the last 90 days, enter:

```powershell
Get-LogCollectionHistory  
```

Here's a sample output of the `Get-LogCollectionHistory` cmdlet. Note that the `datetime` parameters are in the UTC timezone.

```output
PS C:\CloudDeployment\logs> Get-LogCollectionHistory

## Save logs to a local file share

You can store diagnostic logs on a local Server Message Block (SMB) share if you have network issues or prefer to save data locally instead of sending it to Azure.

Follow these steps to save logs to a local share:

1. Run the following command to create a share:

   ```powershell
   New-SMBShare -Name <share-name> -Path <path-to-share> -FullAccess Users -ChangeAccess 'Server Operators'
   ```

1. Run the following commands to create PSCredentials to the share:

   ```powershell
   $user = "<username>"
   $pass = "<password>"
   $sec=ConvertTo-SecureString -String $pass -AsPlainText -Force
   $shareCredential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($user, $sec)
   ```

1. Run the following command on each node of the cluster to collect logs and save them locally:

   ```powershell
   Send-DiagnosticData -SaveToPath <path to share> -ShareCredential $shareCredential
   ```

If you have outbound connectivity from the SMB share where you saved the logs, you can run the following command to send the logs to Microsoft:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData NoLogCollection -SupplementaryLogs <path-to-share> -ShareCredentail $shareCredential
```

## Provide required information in a support case

If you encounter an issue and need help from Microsoft Support, they might ask for specific information to locate your logs.

You can obtain this information from either the output of the `Send-DiagnosticData` cmdlet or directly from the problematic page in the Azure portal.

### Provide information from the `Send-DiagnosticData` output

When you use `Send-DiagnosticData` to collect logs, it also provides key details in its output that you need to share with Microsoft Support. After you collect logs, they're sent to the Kusto database. Microsoft Support can then use the information provided to locate your logs in Kusto and help you in resolving the reported issue.

When requested, share the following information with Microsoft Support. Get this information from the `Send-DiagnosticData` output.

- `AEORegion`: The location where your device is registered.
- `AEODeviceARMResourceUri`: A unique identifier to locate the resource, for example: `/subscriptions/<subscription GUID>/resourceGroups/<Name of Resource group>/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI/clusters/<Name of Cluster>`.
- `AEOClusterNodeArcResourceUri`: A unique identifier to locate the ARC resource, for example: `/subscriptions/<subscription GUID>/resourceGroups/<Name of Resource group>/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/Machines/<machine name>`.
- `CorrelationId`: A unique identifier to locate the logs.

### Provide information from the Azure portal page where issue occurs

On the problematic page in the Azure portal, press CTRL+ALT+A to download a diagnostic file with the following information: session ID and the URL. In most cases, this information is sufficient to get Microsoft Support started on troubleshooting.

If you're on any of the Azure Stack HCI blades where you're experiencing issues, the current URI has the resource ID needed to debug the service.

## `Send-DiagnosticData` command reference

This section provides reference information on `Send-DiagnosticData`, including its parameters, syntax, and usage examples.

### FromDate and ToDate

These parameters enable you to collect logs for a specific time period.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [[-FilterByRole] <string[]>] [[-FromDate] <datetime>] [[-ToDate] <datetime>] [[-CollectSddc] <bool>]  [<CommonParameters>]
```

**Example**

```powershell
$fromDate = Get-Date -Date "11/30/2023 18:35:00"
$fromDate = Get-Date -Date "11/30/2023 18:35:00"
$toDate = Get-Date -Date "11/30/2023 19:35:00"
Send-DiagnosticData –FromDate $fromDate –ToDate $toDate
```

**Extension version**

All

### FilterByRole

This parameter lets you choose which roles’ logs you want to collect. You can specify multiple roles. For a list of available roles on which you can filter logs, see [Roles available for filtering logs](#roles-available-for-filtering-logs).

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [[-FilterByRole] <string[]>]
```

**Example**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FilterByRole “ALM” -CollectSddc $false
```

**Extension version**

All

### CollectSddc

Determines whether to include or exclude software-defined data center (SDDC) logs. By default, SDDC logs are included. Set it to $false if you want to exclude them. For more information about using SDDC diagnostic tools, see [Collect diagnostic data for clusters](./collect-diagnostic-data.md).

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-CollectSddc <bool>]
```

**Example**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –CollectSddc $false
```

**Extension version**

All

### BypassObsAgent

When bypassing the observability agent, logs are collected only on the node where the log collection was initiated. No record of the collection is kept in the history.

**Syntax**
```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-BypassObsAgent]
```

**Example**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –BypassObsAgent
```

**Extension version**

All

### SaveToPath

This parameter allows you to save the diagnostic logs to a specified path on the host machine, rather than transmitting them to Microsoft.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData -SaveToPath <string> [-FilterByRole <string[]>] [-FromDate <datetime>] [-ToDate <datetime>] [-CollectSddc <bool>] [-SupplementaryLogs <string>] [-ShareCredential <pscredential>] [-BypassObsAgent]  [<CommonParameters>]
```

**Examples**

You can provide either a share path or an output path on the host to the `SaveToPath` parameter.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <output path>
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <share path>
```

If you’re using a share path that is not mapped, you must also use the `-ShareCredential` parameter.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <share path> -ShareCredential <credentials for share path>
```

You can use `SaveToPath` with other parameters, such as `FilterByRole`, `FromDate`, `ToDate`, `CollectSddc`, `SupplementaryLogs`, `ShareCredential`, and `BypassObsAgent`.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <output path> -FIlterByRole <role>
```

**Extension version**

Versions 1.0.2.0 and above

### NoLogCollection

The `NoLogCollection` switch parameter allows you to send an ad-hoc set of logs to Microsoft. When using this parameter, consider the following details:

- You can combine the `SupplementaryLogs`, `ShareCredential`, and `BypassObsAgent` parameters with the `NoLogCollection` parameter.
- The `SupplementaryLogs` parameter is mandatory when using `NoLogCollection`. It specifies the path to the logs that need to be sent to Microsoft.
- You have the flexibility to pass either a share path or an output path on the host to the `SupplementaryLogs` parameter. If you’re using an unmapped share path, you must also use the `-ShareCredential` parameter.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData -SupplementaryLogs <string> -NoLogCollection [-ShareCredential <pscredential>] [-BypassObsAgent]  [<CommonParameters>]
```

**Examples**

Use `–NoLogCollection` with the mandatory `SupplementaryLogs` parameter:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –NoLogCollection –SupplementaryPath <output path>
```

Use `–NoLogCollection` with unmapped share path:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –NoLogCollection –SupplementaryPath <share path>
-ShareCredential <credential to share path>
```

**Extension version**

Versions 1.0.2.0 and above

### SupplementaryLogs

The SupplementaryLogs parameter allows you to send ad-hoc logs to Microsoft.

**Syntax**

You can use it in the following ways:

With `SaveToPath`. In this scenario, both diagnostic logs and ad-hoc logs are collected and saved to a specified path.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-SupplementaryLogs <string>] -SaveToPath <path>
```

With `NoLogCollection`. Here, only ad-hoc logs are collected and sent to Microsoft. No diagnostic logs are collected.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData -SupplementaryLogs <string> -NoLogCollection
```

Without `SaveToPath` or `NoLogCollection`. This means that both diagnostic logs and ad-hoc logs are collected and sent to Microsoft.

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-SupplementaryLogs <string>]
```

When collecting both diagnostic and ad-hoc logs, you can use the `SupplementaryLogs` parameter with other parameters such as `FilterByRole`, `FromDate`, `ToDate`, and `CollectSddc`.

**Examples**

Without `SaveToPath` or `NoLogCollection`:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SupplementaryLogs <path to adhoc logs to collect>
```

With `SaveToPath`:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <path> -SupplementaryLogs <path to adhoc logs to collect>
```

With `NoLogCollection`:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –NoLogCollection –SupplemenatryLogs <path to adhoc logs to collect>
```

**Extension version**

Versions 1.0.2.0 and above

### ShareCredential

This parameter provides the flexibility to either collect logs and save them to a share path or directly send logs from a share path to Microsoft.

**Syntax**

Save logs to a path:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-ShareCredential <pscredential>] -SaveToPath <path>
```

Send logs on a share path to Microsoft:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData [-ShareCredential <pscredential>] -SupplementaryLogs <path> -NoLogCollection;
```

**Examples**

Save logs to a path:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –SaveToPath <share path> -ShareCredential <credential to share path>
```

Send logs on a share path to Microsoft:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –NoLogCollection –SupplementaryLogs <share path> –ShareCredential <credential to the share path>
```

**Extension version**

All

### (Plan to deprecate) ToSMBShare

This parameter allows you to save logs either to an output path or a share path. If you were using a share path that wasn't mapped, you needed to use the `ShareCredential` parameter as well. Since this parameter will be removed in future versions of the extension, use the `-SaveToPath` parameter instead.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <path> [-ShareCredential <pscredential>]
```

**Examples**

Save logs to an output path or share path:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <output path or share path>
```

Save logs to a share path that's not mapped:

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <share path> -ShareCredential <credential for the share path>
```

**Extension version**

Initially accessible across all versions, however, this parameter will eventually be limited to Versions 0.1.42 and earlier.

### (Plan to deprecate) FromSMBShare

This parameter allows you to send logs from an output path or share path directly to Microsoft. If you were using a share path that wasn't mapped, you needed to use the `ShareCredential` parameter as well. Since this parameter will be removed in future versions of the extension, use the `-NoLogCollection` parameter instead.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <path> [-ShareCredential <pscredential>]
```

**Examples**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <output path or share path>
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <share path>
```

**Extension version**

Initially accessible across all versions, however, this parameter will eventually be limited to Versions 0.1.42 and earlier.

### (Plan to deprecate) SharePath

The SharePath parameter can be used for one of the following purposes:

- Save diagnostic logs to a share path or output path.
- Send logs to Microsoft from a share path or output path. If you're using a share path and the share path is not mapped, then the `ShareCredential` parameter must also be used.

Since this parameter will be removed in future versions of the extension, use the `–SaveToPath` to save logs to a path, or `–SupplementaryLogs` when sending ad-hoc logs to Microsoft instead.

**Syntax**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <path> [-ShareCredential <pscredential>];
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <path> [-ShareCredential <pscredential>];
```

**Examples**

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <output path or share path>
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –ToSMBShare –SharePath <share path> -ShareCredential <credential for the share path>
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <output path or share path>
```

```powershell
Send-DiagnosticData –FromSMBShare –SharePath <share path>
```

**Extension version**

Initially accessible across all versions, however, this parameter will eventually be limited to Versions 0.1.42 and earlier.

### Roles available for filtering logs

The following roles are available for filtering by the **FilterByRole** parameter. The available roles may be different in a future release.
