# Manage Network ATC

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2

This article discusses how to manage Network ATC after it has been deployed. Network ATC simplifies the deployment and network configuration management for Azure Stack HCI clusters. You use Windows PowerShell to manage Network ATC.

## Add a server node

You can add nodes to a cluster. Each node in the cluster receives the same intent, improving the reliability of the cluster. The new server node must meet all requirements as listed in the Requirements and best practices section of [Host networking with Network ATC](../deploy/network-atc.md).

In this task, you will add additional nodes to the cluster and observe how a consistent networking configuration is enforced across all nodes in the cluster.

1. Use the `Add-ClusterNode` cmdlet to add the additional (unconfigured) nodes to the cluster. You only need management access to the cluster at this time. Each node in the cluster should have all pNICs named the same.

    ```powershell
    Add-ClusterNode -Cluster HCI01
    Get-ClusterNode
    ```

1. Check the status across all cluster nodes using the `-ClusterName` parameter.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetIntentStatus -ClusterName HCI01
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If one of the servers you're adding to the cluster is missing a network adapter that's present on the other servers, `Get-NetIntentStatus` reports the error `PhysicalAdapterNotFound`.

1. Check the provisioning status of all nodes using `Get-NetIntentStatus`. The cmdlet reports the configuration for both nodes. Note that this may take a similar amount of time to provision as the original node.

    ```powershell
    Get-NetIntentStatus -ClusterName HCI01
    ```

You can also add several nodes to the cluster at once.

## Update an intent network adapter

This task will help you update the network adapters assigned to an intent. If there are changes to the physical adapters in your cluster, you can use `Update-NetIntentAdapter` to update the relevant intents. 

In this example we installed two new adapters, pNIC03 and pNIC04, and we want them to be used in our intent named 'Cluster_Compute'.

1. On one of the cluster nodes, run `Get-NetAdapter` to check that both adapters are present and report status of 'Up' on each cluster node. 

    ``` powershell
    Get-NetAdapter -Name pNIC03, pNIC04 -CimSession (Get-ClusterNode).Name | Select Name, PSComputerName
    ```

1. Run the following command to update the intent to include the old and new network adapters. 

    ``` powershell
     Update-NetIntentAdapter -Name Cluster_Compute -AdapterName pNIC01,pNIC02,pNIC03,pNIC04 -ClusterName HCI01
    ```

1. Check that the net adapters were successfully added to the intent.

    ``` powershell
    Get-NetIntent -Name Cluster_Compute -ClusterName HCI01
    ```


## Update an intent override

This task will help you override the default configuration which has already been deployed. This example modifies the default bandwidth reservation for SMB Direct.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend using the default settings, which are based on Microsoft's best practices.


1. Get a list of possible override cmdlets. We use wildcards to see the options available:

    ```powershell
    Get-Command -Noun NetIntent*Over* -Module NetworkATC
    ```

1. Create an override object for the DCB Quality of Service (QoS) configuration:

    ```powershell
    $QosOverride = New-NetIntentQosPolicyOverrides
    $QosOverride
    ```

1. Modify the bandwidth percentage for SMB Direct:

    ```powershell
    $QosOverride.BandwidthPercentage_SMB = 25
    $QosOverride
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Values are only shown for the properties that you override.

1. Submit the intent request specifying the override:

    ```powershell
    Set-NetIntent -Name Cluster_ComputeStorage -QosPolicyOverrides $QosOverride
    ```

1. Wait for the provisioning status to complete:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetIntentStatus -Name Cluster_ComputeStorage | Format-Table IntentName, Host, ProvisioningStatus, ConfigurationStatus
    ```

1. Check that the override has been properly set on all cluster nodes. In the example, the SMB_Direct traffic class was overridden with a bandwidth percentage of 25%:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetQosTrafficClass -Cimsession (Get-ClusterNode).Name | Select PSComputerName, Name, Priority, Bandwidth
    ```

## Remove an intent

If you want to test various configurations on the same adapters, you may need to remove an intent. 

If you previously deployed and configured Network ATC on your system, you may need to reset the node so that the configuration can be deployed. To do this, copy and paste the following commands to remove all existing intents and their corresponding vSwitch:

```powershell
    $intents = Get-NetIntent
    foreach ($intent in $intents)
    {
        Remove-NetIntent -Name $intent.IntentName
        Remove-VMSwitch -Name "*$($intent.IntentName)*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force
    }
    
    Get-NetQosTrafficClass | Remove-NetQosTrafficClass
    Get-NetQosPolicy | Remove-NetQosPolicy -Confirm:$false
    Get-NetQosFlowControl | Disable-NetQosFlowControl
```

## Post-deployment tasks

There are several tasks to complete following a Network ATC deployment, including the following:

- **Add DHCP or static IP addresses to storage adapters:** Use DHCP on the storage VLANs or set static IP addresses using the NetIPAdress cmdlet. You can't use the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) addresses given to adapters that can't get an address from a DHCP server.

- **Set SMB bandwidth limits:** If live migration uses SMB Direct (RDMA), configure a bandwidth limit to ensure that live migration does not consume all the bandwidth used by Storage Spaces Direct and Failover Clustering.

- **Stretched cluster configuration:** To add Stretch S2D to your ATC managed system you must manually add the appropriate configuration (including vNICs, etc.) after the ATC has implemented the specified intent. Additionally, the following limitations exist: 
   - All nodes in the cluster must use the same intent.
   - There is no automatic provisioning for storage replica.

## Validate automatic remediation
Network ATC ensures that the deployed configuration stays the same across all cluster nodes. In this optional section, we will modify our configuration (without an override) emulating an accidental configuration change and observe how the reliability of the system is improved by remediating the misconfigured property.

1. Check the adapter's existing MTU (JumboPacket) value:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name pNIC01, pNIC02, vSMB* -RegistryKeyword *JumboPacket -Cimsession (Get-ClusterNode).Name
    ```

1. Modify one of the physical adapter's MTU without specifying an override. This emulates an accidental change or "configuration drift" which must be remediated.

    ```powershell
    Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name pNIC01 -RegistryKeyword *JumboPacket -RegistryKeyword *JumboPacket -RegistryValue 4088
    ```

1. Verify that the adapter's existing MTU (JumboPacket) value has been modified:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name pNIC01, pNIC02, vSMB* -RegistryKeyword *JumboPacket -Cimsession (Get-ClusterNode).Name
    ```

1. Retry the configuration. This step is only performed to expedite the remediation. Network ATC will automatically remediate this configuration.

    ```powershell
    Set-NetIntentRetryState -ClusterName HCI01 -Name Cluster_ComputeStorage
    ```

1. Verify that the consistency check has completed:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetIntentStatus -ClusterName HCI01 -Name Cluster_ComputeStorage
    ```

1. Verify that the adapter's MTU (JumboPacket) value has returned to the expected value:

    ```powershell
    Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name pNIC01, pNIC02, vSMB* -RegistryKeyword *JumboPacket -Cimsession (Get-ClusterNode).Name
    ```
