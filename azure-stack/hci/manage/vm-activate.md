# License Windows Server VMs on Azure Stack HCI

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Edition and later

Windows Server virtual machines (VMs) must be licensed and activated before you can use them on Azure Stack HCI. You can use any existing Windows Server licenses and activation methods that you already have. Optionally, Azure Stack HCI offers new licensing models and tools to help simplify this process. This article describes general licensing concepts and the new options that are available on Azure Stack HCI.

## Summary

The following figure shows the different Windows Server VM licensing options:

:::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/vm-activation-server.png" alt-text="VM licensing":::

First, choose one of two licensing options:

- **Windows Server subscription**: Subscribe to Windows Server guest licenses through Azure. Available for Azure Stack HCI only.
- **Bring your own license (BYOL)**: Apply your existing Windows Server licenses.

For more information, see [Compare licensing options](#compare-licensing-options).

Next, activate your Windows Server VMs:

- If you are using Windows Server subscription, AVMA is automatically enabled on the host. You can immediately activate VMs against the cluster using generic AVMA client keys.
- If you are using BYOL, you must use the corresponding keys associated with your license and apply them using your chosen activation method. One of the most convenient ways is to use *Automatic VM Activation* (AVMA).
- To use other methods to activate VMs, see [Key Management Services (KMS) activation planning](/windows-server/get-started/kms-activation-planning).

## Tutorial: Windows Server subscription

Windows Server subscription enables you to subscribe to Windows Server guest licensing on Azure Stack HCI through Azure.

### How does Windows Server subscription work?

When Windows Server subscription is purchased, Azure Stack HCI servers retrieve licenses from the cloud and automatically set up AVMA on the cluster. After setting up AVMA, you can then apply the generic AVMA keys on the client side.

:::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/windows-server-subscription.png" alt-text="Windows Server subscription":::

### Prerequisites

- An Azure Stack HCI cluster
  - [Install updates](update-cluster.md): Version 21H2, with at least the December 14, 2021 security update KB5008210 or later.
  - [Register Azure Stack HCI](../deploy/register-with-azure.md?tab=windows-admin-center#register-a-cluster): All servers must be online and registered to Azure.

- If using Windows Admin Center:
  - Windows Admin Center (version 2103 or later) with the Cluster Manager extension (version 2.41.0 or later).

### Enable Windows Server subscription using the Azure portal

1. In your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page, navigate to the **Configuration** screen.
2. Under the feature **Windows Server subscription add-on**, select **Purchase.** In the context pane, select **Purchase** again to confirm.
3. When Windows Server subscription has been successfully purchased, you can start using Windows Server VMs on your cluster. Licenses will take a few minutes to be applied on your cluster.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/portal-purchase.png" alt-text="Purchase confirmation" lightbox="media/vm-activation/portal-purchase-expanded.png":::

### Troubleshooting - Windows Server subscription

**Error**: One or more servers in the cluster does not have the latest changes to this setting. We'll apply the changes as soon as the servers sync again.

**Remediation**: Your cluster does not yet have the latest status on Windows Server subscription (for example, you just enrolled or just canceled), and therefore might not have retrieved the licenses to set up AVMA. In most cases, the next cloud sync will resolve this discrepancy, or you can sync manually. See [Syncing Azure Stack HCI](../faq.yml#how-often-does-azure-stack-hci-sync-with-the-cloud).

### Enable Windows Server subscription using Windows Admin Center

1. Select **Cluster Manager** from the top drop-down, navigate to the cluster that you want to activate, then under **Settings**, select **Activate Windows Server VMs**.
2. In the **Automatically activate VMs** pane, select **Set up**, and then select **Purchase Windows Server subscription.** Select **Next** and confirm details, then select **Purchase.**
3. When you complete the purchase successfully, the cluster retrieves licenses from the cloud, and sets up AVMA on your cluster.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/confirm-purchase.gif" alt-text="Confirm purchase":::

### Enable Windows Server subscription using PowerShell

- **Purchase Windows Server subscription**: From your cluster, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-AzStackHCI -EnableWSsubscription $true
   ```

- **Check status**: To check subscription status for each server, run the following command on each server:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureStackHCISubscriptionStatus
   ```

- To check that AVMA has been set up with Windows Server subscription, run the following command on each server:

  ```powershell
  Get-VMAutomaticActivation
  ```

## Activate VMs against a host server

Now that AVMA has been enabled through Windows Server subscription, you can activate VMs against the host server by following the steps in [Automatic Virtual Machine Activation in Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation).

## Tutorial: Bring your own license (BYOL) activation through AVMA

You can use any existing method to activate VMs on Azure Stack HCI. Optionally, you can use AVMA, which enables activated host servers to automatically activate VMs running on them. For more information, see [AVMA in Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation).

:::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/vm-activate.png" alt-text="Activate VMs":::

### Benefits of AVMA

VM activation through host servers presents several benefits:

- Individual VMs don't have to be connected to the internet. Only licensed host servers with internet connectivity are required.
- License management is simplified. Instead of having to true-up key usage counts for individual VMs, you can activate any number of VMs with just a properly licensed server.
- AVMA acts as a proof-of-purchase mechanism. This capability helps to ensure that Windows products are used in accordance with product use rights and Microsoft software license terms.

### Prerequisites - activation

Before you begin:

- Get the required Windows Server Datacenter key(s):
  - **Key editions:** Windows Server 2019 Datacenter or later. For information about what guest versions your key activates, see [Guest versions](#guest-versions).
  - **Number of keys:** One unique key for each host server you are activating, unless you have a valid volume license key.
  - **Consistency across cluster:** All servers in a cluster need to use the same edition of keys, so that VMs stay activated regardless of which server they run on.

- An Azure Stack HCI cluster (version 20H2 with the June 8, 2021 cumulative update or later).
- Windows Admin Center (version 2103 or later).
- The Cluster Manager extension for Windows Admin Center (version 1.523.0 or later).

> [!NOTE]
> For VMs to stay activated regardless of which server they run on, AVMA must be set up for each server in the cluster.

### AVMA using Windows Admin Center

You can use Windows Admin Center to set up and manage product keys for your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

#### Apply activation keys

To use AVMA in Windows Admin Center:

1. Select **Cluster Manager** from the top drop-down arrow, navigate to the cluster that you want to activate, then under **Settings**, select **Activate Windows Server VMs**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vm-activation/apply-keys.gif" alt-text="Apply keys":::

1. In the **Automatically activate VMs** pane, select **Set up** and then select **Use existing Windows Server licenses**. In the **Apply activation keys to each server** pane, enter your Windows Server Datacenter keys.

   When you have finished entering keys for each host server in the cluster, select **Apply**. The process then takes a few minutes to complete.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Each server requires a unique key, unless you have a valid volume license key.

1. Now that AVMA has been enabled, you can activate VMs against the host server by following the steps in [Automatic Virtual Machine Activation](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation).

### Change or add keys later (optional)

You might want to either change or add keys later; for example, when you add a server to the cluster, or use new Windows Server VM versions.

To change or add keys:

1. In the **Activate Windows Server VMs** pane, select the servers that you want to manage, and then select **Manage activation keys**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vm-activation/change.gif" alt-text="Short demonstration showing how to change or add keys in Windows Admin Center." lightbox="./media/vm-activation/change.gif":::

2. In the **Manage activation keys** pane, enter the new keys for the selected host servers, and then select **Apply**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Overwriting keys does not reset the activation count for used keys. Ensure that you're using the right keys before applying them to the servers.

### Troubleshooting - Windows Admin Center

If you receive the following AVMA error messages, try using the verification steps in this section to resolve them.

#### Error 1: "The key you entered didn't work"

This error might be due to one of the following issues:

- A key submitted to activate a server in the cluster was not accepted.
- A disruption of the activation process prevented a server in the cluster from being activated.
- A valid key hasn't yet been applied to a server that was added to the cluster.

To resolve such issues, in the **Activate Windows Server VMs** window, select the server with the warning, and then select **Manage activation keys** to enter a new key.

#### Error 2: "Some servers use keys for an older version of Windows Server"

All servers must use the same version of keys. Update the keys to the same version to ensure that the VMs stay activated regardless of which server they run on.

#### Error 3: "Server is down"

Your server is offline and cannot be reached. Bring all servers online and then refresh the page.

#### Error 4: "Couldn't check the status on this server" or "To use this feature, install the latest update"

One or more of your servers is not updated and does not have the required packages to set up AVMA. Ensure that your cluster is updated, and then refresh the page. For more information, see [Update Azure Stack HCI clusters](./update-cluster.md).

### AVMA using PowerShell

You can also use PowerShell to set up and manage key-based AVMA for your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

Open PowerShell as an administrator, and run the following commands:

1. Apply Windows Server Datacenter keys to each server:

    ```powershell
     Set-VMAutomaticActivation <product key>
    ```

1. View and confirm Automatic Virtual Machine Activation status:

    ```powershell
     Get-VMAutomaticActivation
    ```

1. Repeat these steps on each of the other servers in your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

Now that you have set up AVMA through BYOL, you can activate VMs against the host server by [following the steps here](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation).

## FAQ

This FAQ provides answers to some questions about licensing Windows Server.

### Will my Windows Server Datacenter Azure Edition guests activate on Azure Stack HCI?

Yes, but you must use either Windows Server subscription-based AVMA, or else bring Windows Server Datacenter keys with **Software Assurance**. For BYOL, you can use either:

- [AVMA client keys](/windows-server/get-started/automatic-vm-activation#avma-keys)
- [KMS client keys](/windows-server/get-started/kms-client-activation-keys#generic-volume-license-keys-gvlk)

### Do I still need Windows Server CALs?

Yes, you still need Windows Server CALs for BYOL, but not for Windows Server subscription.

### Do I need to be connected to the internet?

You do need internet connectivity:

- To sync host servers to Azure at least once every 30 days, in order to maintain Azure Stack HCI 30-day connectivity requirements and to sync host licenses for AVMA.
- When purchasing or canceling Windows Server subscription.

You do not need internet connectivity:

- For VMs to activate via Windows Server subscription or BYOL-based AVMA. For connectivity requirements for other forms of activation, see the [Windows Server documentation](/windows-server/get-started/kms-activation-planning).

### When does Windows Server subscription start/end billing?

Windows Server subscription starts billing and activating Windows Server VMs immediately upon purchase. If you enable Windows Server subscription within the first 60 days of activating Azure Stack HCI, you automatically have a free trial for the duration of that period.

You can sign up or cancel your Windows Server subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, billing and activation via Azure stops immediately. Make sure you have an alternate form of licensing if you continue to run Windows Server VMs on your cluster.

### I have a license for Windows Server, can I run Windows Server 2016 VMs on Azure Stack HCI?

Yes. Although you cannot use Windows Server 2016 keys to set up AVMA on Azure Stack HCI, they can still be applied using [other activation methods](/windows-server/get-started/kms-activation-planning). For example, you can enter a Windows Server 2016 key into your Windows Server 2016 VM directly.

### Where can I get BYOL keys for AVMA?

To get a product key, choose from the following options:

- **OEM provider**: Find a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) key label on the outside of the OEM hardware. You can use this key once per server in the cluster.
- **Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)**: From the VLSC, you can download a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) that you can reuse up to a predetermined number of allowed activations. For more information, see [MAK keys](/licensing/products-keys-faq#what-is-a-multiple-activation-key--mak-).
- **Retail channels**: You can also find a retail key on a retail box label. You can only use this key once per server in the cluster. For more information, see [Packaged Software](https://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/software-packaged).

### I want to change an existing key. What happens to the previous key if the overwrite is successful/unsuccessful?

Once a product key is associated with a device, that association is permanent. Overwriting keys does not reduce the activation count for used keys. If you successfully apply another key, both keys would be considered to have been "used" once. If you unsuccessfully apply a key, your host server activation state remains unchanged and defaults to the last successfully added key.

### I want to change to another key of a different version. Is it possible to switch keys between versions?

You can update to newer versions of keys, or replace existing keys with the same version, but you cannot downgrade to a previous version.

### What happens if I add or remove a new server?

You'll need to [add activation keys](#change-or-add-keys-later-optional) for each new server, so that the Windows Server VMs can be activated against the new server. Removing a server does not impact how AVMA is set up for the remaining servers in the cluster.

### I previously purchased a Windows Server Software-Defined Datacenter (WSSD) solution with a Windows Server 2019 key. Can I use that key for Azure Stack HCI?

Yes, but you'll need to use keys for Windows Server 2022 or later, which will be available after the general availability of Windows Server 2022.
