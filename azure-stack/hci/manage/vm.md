# Manage VMs on Azure Stack HCI using Windows Admin Center

> Applies to Windows Server 2019

Windows Admin Center can be used to create and manage your virtual machines (VMs) on Azure Stack HCI.

## Get a list of VMs

You can easily see all VMs on a server or in your cluster.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-vm/vm-inventory.png" alt-text="Virtual machines screen":::

1. In Windows Admin Center, under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. The  **Inventory** tab on the right lists all VMs available on the current server or the cluster, and provides commands to manage individual VMs. You can:
    - View a list of the VMs running on the current server or cluster.
    - View the VM's state and host server if you are viewing VMs for a cluster. Also view CPU and memory usage from the host perspective, including memory pressure, memory demand and assigned memory, and the VM's uptime, heartbeat status, and protection status (using Azure Site Recovery).
    - Create a new VM.
    - Delete, start, turn off, shut down, pause, resume, reset or rename a VM. Also save the VM, delete a saved state, or create a checkpoint.
    - Change settings for a VM.
    - Connect to a VM console via the Hyper-V host.
    - Replicate a VM using Azure Site Recovery.
    - For operations that can be run on multiple VMs, such as Start, Shut down, Save, Pause, Delete, or Reset, you can select multiple VMs and run the operation once.

## View VM metrics

You can view detailed information and performance charts for a specific VM from its dedicated page.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-vm/vm-details.png" alt-text="Virtual machines detailed info screen":::

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Click the **Inventory** tab on the right, then select the VM. On the subsequent page, you can do the following:

   - View live and historical data line charts for CPU, memory, network, IOPS and IO throughput (historical data is only available for hyperconverged clusters)
   - View, create, apply, rename, and delete checkpoints.
   - View details for the virtual hard disk (.vhd) files, network adapters, and host server.
   - View the state of the VM.
   - Save the VM, delete a saved state, or create a checkpoint.
   - Change settings for the VM.
   - Connect to the VM console using VMConnect via the Hyper-V host.
   - Replicate the VM using Azure Site Recovery.

## View aggregate VM metrics

You can view resources usage and performance metrics for all VMs in your cluster.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-vm/host-metrics.png" alt-text="host metrics screen":::

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. The **Summary** tab on the right provides a holistic view of Hyper-V host resources and performance for a selected server or cluster, including the following:
    - The number of VMs that are running, stopped, paused, and saved
    - Recent health alerts or Hyper-V event log events for clusters
    - CPU and memory usage with host vs guest breakdown
    - Live and historical data line charts for IOPS and I/O throughput for clusters

## Change VM settings

There are a variety of settings that you can change for a VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Some settings cannot be changed for a VM that is running and you will need to stop the VM first.

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Click the **Inventory** tab on the right, select the VM, then click **Settings**.

1. To change VM start/stop actions and general settings, select **General** and do the following:

1. Under **Virtual processors**, select the number of virtual processors and whether you want nested virtualization enabled.
1. Under **Memory**, select the amount of startup memory (4 GB is recommended as a minimum), and a min and max range of dynamic memory as applicable to be allocated to the VM.
1. Under **Network**, select a network adapter from the dropdown list.
1. Under **Storage**, click **Add** and select whether to create a new virtual hard disk or to use an existing virtual hard disk. If you're using an existing virtual hard disk, click **Browse** and select the applicable file path.
1. Under **Operating system**, do one of the following:
   - Select **Install an operating system later** if you want to install an operating system for the VM later.
   - Select **Install an operating system from an image file (*.iso)**, click **Browse**, then select the applicable .iso image file to use.
   - Select **Install an operating system from a network-based installation server** if you want to install an OS on the VM later using this method. Make sure you have selected a network adapter previously or else it won't work.
1. When finished, click **Create** to create the VM.
1. To start the VM, in the **Virtual Machines** list, hover over the new VM, enable the checkbox for it on the left, and select **Start**.
1. Under **State**, verify that the VM state is **Running**.

## Move a VM to another server in the cluster

You can easily move a virtual machine to another server in the cluster as follows:

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-vm/vm-more-move.png" alt-text="Move VM screen":::

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Select the **Inventory** tab on the right. Choose a virtual machine from the list and select **More > Move**.
1. Choose a server from the list and select **Move**.
1. Under **Move Virtual Machine**, select **Failover cluster**, then enter the cluster name and cluster node to move the VM to.
1. After a successful move, you will see the name updated in the list under **Host server**.

## Import or Export a VM

You can easily import or export a VM. The following procedure describes the import process.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-vm/vm-more-import.png" alt-text="Import VM screen":::

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Select the **Inventory** tab on the right. Choose a clustered virtual machine from the list and select **More > Import**.
1. Enter the folder name containing the VM or click **Browse** and select a folder.
1. Select the VM you want to import.
1. Create a unique ID for the VM if needed.
1. When finished, select **Import**.

For exporting a VM, the process is very similar. simply select **More > Export** instead.

## View VM event logs

You can view VM event logs as follows:

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. On the **Summary** tab on the right, select **View all events**.
1. Select an event category and expand the view.

## Connect to a VM by using Remote Desktop

Instead of using Windows Admin Center, you can also manage your VMs through a Hyper-V host using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection.

1. Under **Tools**, scroll down and select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Select the **Inventory** tab on the right. Choose a virtual machine from the list and select **More > Connect** or **More > Download RDP file** option. Both options use the VMConnect tool to connect to the guest VM through the Hyper-V host and requires you to enter your administrator username and password credentials for the Hyper-V host.

    - The **Connect** option connects to the VM using Remote Desktop in your web browser.

    - The **Download RDP file** option downloads an .rdp file that you can open to connect with the Remote Desktop Connection app (mstsc.exe).

## Protect VMs with Azure Site Recovery

You can use Windows Admin Center to configure Azure Site Recovery and replicate your on-premises VMs to Azure. This is an optional value-add service. To get started, see [Protect VMs using Azure Site Recovery](azure-site-recovery.md).
