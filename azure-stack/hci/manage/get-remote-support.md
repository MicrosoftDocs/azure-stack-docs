# Get remote support for Azure Stack HCI (preview)

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and 21H2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remote support for Azure Stack HCI is currently in preview.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This topic provides guidance on how to get remote support for your Azure Stack HCI operating system.

You can use remote support to allow a Microsoft support professional to solve your support case faster by permitting access to your device remotely and performing limited troubleshooting and repair. You can enable this feature by granting consent while controlling the access level and
duration of access. Microsoft support can access your device only after a [support request is submitted](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

Once enabled, Microsoft support gets just-in-time (JIT) limited time access to your device over a secure, audited, and compliant channel. Remote support uses the HTTPS protocol over port 443. The traffic is encrypted with TLS 1.2. Operations performed are restricted based on the
access level granted using [just enough administration](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/overview) (JEA).

## Why use remote support?

Remote support gives you the ability to:

- Improve the speed to resolution as Microsoft support no longer needs to arrange a meeting with you for troubleshooting.
- View the detailed transcript of all executed operations at any time.
- Grant just-in-time authenticated access on an incident-by-incident basis. You can define the access level and duration for each incident.
- Revoke consent at any time, which in turn terminates the remote session. Access is automatically disabled once the consent duration expires.

## Before you begin

Before you begin using remote support, you must:

- [Submit a support request](#submit-a-support-request)
- [Create a KDS root key](#create-a-kds-root-key)
- [Install the Az.StackHCI PowerShell module](#install-powershell-module)
- [Configure proxy settings](#configure-proxy-settings)
- [Install JEA configurations](#install-jea-configurations-before-azure-registration)
- [Install Remote Support extension](#grant-remote-support-access)
- [Grant remote support access](#grant-remote-support-access)

### Submit a support request

Microsoft support can access your device only after a support request is submitted. For information about how to create and manage support requests, see [Create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

### Create a KDS root key

Your Active Directory environment must contain a Key Distribution Services (KDS) root key in order to host gMSA accounts.

Run the following cmdlet to determine if your environment contains a KDS root key:

```powershell
Get-KDSRootKey
```

If the results are null, follow the steps given in the [Create the Key Distribution Services KDS Root Key](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/create-the-key-distribution-services-kds-root-key#to-create-the-kds-root-key-using-the-add-kdsrootkey-cmdlet) article to create a KDS root key.

> [!NOTE]
> It could take several hours for full Active Directory replication before you can successfully grant remote support access.

### Install PowerShell module

Install the Az.StackHCI PowerShell module. Make sure that the module is updated to the latest version if already installed:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.StackHCI
```

If not already installed, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name "RSAT-AD-PowerShell" -IncludeAllSubFeature
```

### Configure proxy settings

If you are using a proxy with Azure Stack HCI, include the following endpoints in your allowlist:

- \*.servicebus.windows.net
- \*.core.windows.net
- login.microsoftonline.com
- https\://edgesupprdwestuufrontend.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com
- https\://edgesupprdwesteufrontend.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
- https\://edgesupprdeastusfrontend.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
- https\://edgesupprdwestcufrontend.westcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com
- https\://edgesupprdasiasefrontend.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com
- https\://edgesupprd.trafficmanager.net

### Install JEA configurations (before Azure registration)

A local domain administrator must install the following JEA configurations to grant remote support access. If the cluster is not registered with Azure, Microsoft support will provide you with the shared access signature (SAS) token required to enable remote support.

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| Install-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport | Install remote support agent |
|Enable-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport -AccessLevel `<Access Diagnostics or DiagnosticsRepair>` -AgreeToRemoteSupportConsent -ExpireInMinutes `<NumberOfMinutes>` -SasCredential `<SAS>`  | Grant remote support access by providing consent details and SAS token |
| Disable-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport | Disable remote support access by revoking consent |
| Get-AzStackHCIRemoteSupportAccess -Cluster  -IncludeExpired | Check the current remote support access status |
| Get-AzStackHCIRemoteSupportSessionHistory –FromDate `<DateTime>` -IncludeSessionTranscript –SessionId `<ID>` | View the remote support session history  |
| Remove-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport | Uninstall remote support agent |

For example scenarios that show how to perform various operations to grant remote support access for Microsoft support, see the [Remote support examples](#remote-support-examples) section later in this article.  

### Install Remote Support extension (after Azure registration)

Install the Remote Support extension from the Windows Admin Center Extensions feed. Make sure that the Remote Support extension is updated to the latest version if already installed.

### Grant remote support access

Before remote support is enabled, you must provide consent to authorize Microsoft support to execute diagnostic or repair commands. Carefully read the [remote support terms and conditions](#remote-support-terms-and-conditions) before granting access.

## Remote support examples

The following example scenarios show you how to perform various operations to grant remote support access for Microsoft support.

### Enable remote support for diagnostics

In this example, you grant remote support access for diagnostic related operations only. The consent expires in 1,440 minutes (one day) after which remote access cannot be established.

```powershell
Enable-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport -AccessLevel Diagnostics -ExpireInMinutes 1440
```

Use **ExpireInMinutes** parameter to set the duration of the session. In the example, consent expires in 1,440 minutes (one day). After one day, remote access cannot be established.

You can set **ExpireInMinutes** a minimum duration of 60 minutes (one hour) and a maximum of 20,160 minutes (14 days).

If duration is not defined, the remote session expires in 480 (8 hours) by default.

### Enable remote support for diagnostics and repair

In this example, you grant remote support access for diagnostic and repair related operations only. Because expiration was not explicitly provided, it expires in eight hours by default.

```powershell
Enable-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport -AccessLevel DiagnosticsRepair
```

### Retrieve existing consent grants

In this example, you retrieve any previously granted consent. The result includes expired consent in the last 30 days.

```powershell
Get-AzStackHCIRemoteSupportAccess -IncludeExpired
```

### Revoke remote access consent

In this example, you revoke remote access consent. Any existing sessions are terminated and new sessions can no longer be established.

```powershell
Disable-AzStackHCIRemoteSupport
```

### List existing remote sessions

In this example, you list all the remote sessions that were made to the device since *FromDate*.

```powershell
Get-AzStackHCIRemoteSupportSessionHistory -FromDate <Date>
```

### Get details on a specific remote session

In this example, you get the details for remote session with the ID *SessionID*.

```powershell
Get-AzStackHCIRemoteSupportSessionHistory -IncludeSessionTranscript -SessionId <SessionId>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Session transcript details are retained for ninety days. You can retrieve detail for a remote session within ninety days after the session.

## List of Microsoft support operations

You can grant Microsoft support one of the following access levels for remote support:

- **Diagnostics:** To view diagnostic info and logs
- **Diagnostics and repair:** To view diagnostic info and logs in addition to perform software repairs

The following section lists the allowed diagnostic commands that Microsoft support can execute during a remote support session.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the repair commands will be available at a later date.

### Access level: Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** access level includes the following commands that Microsoft support can execute during a remote support session:

```powershell
Get-AzureStackHCI
Get-Cluster
Get-ClusterGroup
Get-ClusterNode
Get-ClusterOwnerNode
Get-ClusterResource
Get-ClusterSharedVolume
Get-NetAdapter
Get-NetAdapterRdma

## Remote support terms and conditions

The following are the data handling terms and conditions for remote access. Carefully read them before granting access.

> By approving this request, the Microsoft support organization or the Azure engineering team supporting this feature ("Microsoft Support Engineer") will be given direct access to your device for troubleshooting purposes and/or resolving the technical issue described
in the Microsoft support case.
>
> During a remote support session, a Microsoft Support Engineer may need to collect logs. By enabling remote support, you have agreed to a diagnostics log collection by a Microsoft Support Engineer to address a support case. You also acknowledge and consent to the upload and
retention of those logs in an Azure storage account managed and controlled by Microsoft. These logs may be accessed by Microsoft in the context of a support case and to improve the health of Azure Stack HCI.
> 
> The data will be used only to troubleshoot failures that are subject to a support ticket, and will not be used for marketing, advertising, or any other commercial purposes without your consent. The data may be retained for up to ninety (90) days and will be handled following our
standard privacy practices.
