# Monitor Azure Stack HCI with Insights

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-22h2-21h2.md)]

This article explains how to monitor an Azure Stack HCI cluster using Insights. Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that quickly gets you started monitoring your Azure Stack HCI cluster. You can view key metrics, health, and usage information regarding cluster, servers, virtual machines, and storage.

## Benefits of Insights

Insights offers the following benefits:

- **Managed by Azure.** Insights is managed by Azure and accessed through the Azure portal, ensuring it's always up to date. There's no need for database or special software setup.

- **Scalability.** Insights is capable of loading over 400 cluster information sets across multiple subscriptions simultaneously. There are no limitations on cluster, domain, or physical location.

- **Customizability.** The Insight's experience is built on top of Azure Monitor workbook templates. This allows you to change the views and queries, modify or set thresholds that align with your specific limits, and then save these customizations into a workbook. You can then pin charts in the workbooks to the Azure dashboards.

## Configure Insights

The prerequisites and settings for using Insights vary depending on the version of Azure Stack HCI you have. Select one of the following tabs for instructions on how to use Insights on your specific version of Azure Stack HCI.

The Insights feature in Azure Stack HCI, versions 22H2 and later, uses [Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) (AMA), which offers significant advantages compared to the Legacy agents used in Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2 and earlier. These advantages include improved speed, enhanced security, and superior performance. You can onboard new nodes to AMA or [migrate](#migrate-from-the-microsoft-monitoring-agent) your existing nodes from the Legacy agent to AMA.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you upgrade your Azure Stack HCI system to version 22H2 or later to take advantage of the Insights experience with AMA.

# [Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 and later](#tab/22h2-and-later)

Starting with the May 2023 cumulative update for Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, you can monitor on-premises Azure Stack HCI systems with Insights.

### Prerequisites

Here are the prerequisites for using Insights:

- Azure Stack HCI cluster should be [registered](../deploy/register-with-azure.md) with Azure and Arc-enabled. If you registered your cluster on or after June 15, 2021, this happens by default. Otherwise, you must enable [Azure Arc integration](../deploy/register-with-azure.md?enable-azure-arc-integration).

- The cluster must have Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 and the May 2023 cumulative update or later installed.

- The managed identity for the Azure resource must be enabled. For more information, see [Enabled enhanced management](azure-enhanced-management-managed-identity.md).

### Enable Insights

Enabling Insights helps you monitor all Azure Stack HCI clusters currently associated with the Log Analytics workspace by providing useful health metrics. Insights installs the Azure Monitor Agent and helps you to configure [data collection rules (DCRs)](#data-collection-rules) for monitoring your Azure Stack HCI cluster.

To enable this capability from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page, then select your cluster. Under the **Capabilities** tab, select **Insights**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-tile.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Insights tile." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-tile.png":::

1. On the **Insights** page, select **Get Started**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Get Started button." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/get-started.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Get Started** button is available only for Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 with the May 2023 cumulative update or later installed and only after the managed identity is enabled. Otherwise, this button is disabled.

1. On the **Insights configuration** page, select an existing DCR from the **Data collection rule** dropdown. The DCR specifies the event logs and performance counters that need to be collected and stores it in a Log Analytics workspace. Insights creates a default DCR if one doesn't already exist. Only the DCRs that are enabled for Insights are included.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Insights configuration window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule.png":::

1. (Optional) You can also create a new DCR by selecting **Create New** on the **Insights configuration** page.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > We strongly recommend that you don't create your own DCR. The DCR created by Insights includes a special data stream required for its operation. You can edit this DCR to collect more data, such as Windows and Syslog events. The DCRs created through AMA installation will have a prefix `AzureStackHCI-` attached with the DCR name.

   1. On the **New data collection rule** page, specify the subscription, DCR name, and data collection endpoint (DCE) name. DCEs are used to access the configuration service to fetch associated DCRs for Azure Monitor Agent. For more information about DCE, see [Data collection endpoints in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview).

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you're using private links on the agent, you must add DCEs. For more information about AMA network settings, see [Define Azure Monitor Agent network settings](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-data-collection-endpoint?tabs=PowerShellWindows).

      :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the data collection rule window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule-2.png":::

   1. Select the **Review + create** button.

      If a DCR hasn't already been created for the unmonitored cluster, then one is created with performance counters enabled and the Windows event log channel enabled.

1. Review the final screen with a summary of DCR name, number of event logs, performance counters, and name of the Log Analytics workspace in which data is stored. Select **Set up**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the data collection rule dropdown selector." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/data-collection-rule-3.png":::

   After selecting **Set up**, you're redirected to the **Extensions** page, where you can see the status of your agent installation. By configuring Insights, AMA is automatically installed on all nodes of the cluster.

1. Go to your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page, and then select your cluster. Insights now shows as **Configured** on the **Capabilities** tab:

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Insights tile as Configured." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-configured.png":::

### Data collection rules

When you enable Insights on a machine with the Azure Monitor Agent, you must specify a DCR to use. For more information about DCRs, see [Data collection rules in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview).

|**Option**|**Description**|
|--|--|
|Performance Counters|Specifies what data performance counters to collect from the operating system. This option is required for all computers. These performance counters are used to populate the visualizations in the Insights workbook. Currently, Insights workbook uses five performance counters - `Memory()\Available Bytes`, `Network Interface()\Bytes Total/sec`, `Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time`, `RDMA Activity()\RDMA Inbound Bytes/sec`, and `RDMA Activity()\RDMA Outbound Bytes/sec`|
|Event Log Channel|Specifies which Windows event logs to collect from the operating system. This option is required for all computers. Windows event logs are used to populate the visualizations in the Insights workbook. Currently, data is collected through two Windows event log channels: `- microsoft-windows-health/operational` and `microsoft-windows-sddc-management/operational`|
|Log Analytics workspace|Workspace to store the data. Only workspaces with Insights are listed.|

#### Event channel

The `Microsoft-windows-sddc-management/operational` and `Microsoft-windows-health/operational` Windows event channel is added to your Log Analytics workspace under **Windows event logs**.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/event-channel.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Add data source window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/event-channel.png":::

By collecting these logs, Insights shows the health status of the individual servers, drives, volumes, and VMs. By default, five performance counters are added.

#### Performance counters

By default, five performance counters are added:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing performance counters added." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png":::

The following table describes the performance counters that are monitored:

| Performance counters | Description |
|--|--|
| Memory(*)\Available Bytes | Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in bytes, immediately available for allocation to a process or for system use. |
| Network Interface(*)\Bytes Total/sec | The rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter, including framing characters. Bytes Total/sec is a sum of Bytes Received/sec and Bytes Sent/sec. |
| Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time | The percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. |
| RDMA Activity(*)\RDMA Inbound Bytes/sec | Rate of data received over RDMA by the network adapter per second. |
| RDMA Activity(*)\RDMA Outbound Bytes/sec | Rate of data sent over RDMA by the network adapter per second. |

After you enable Insights, it can take up to 15 minutes to collect the data. When the process is finished, you'll be able to see a rich visualization of the health of your cluster from the **Insights** menu on the left pane:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-visualization.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Insight visualizations." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/insights-visualization.png":::

### Disable Insights

To disable Insights, follow these steps:

1. Select **Insights** under the **Capabilities** tab.
2. Select **Disable Insights**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/disable-insights-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Disable Insights window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/disable-insights-new.png":::

When you disable the Insights feature, the association between the data collection rule and the cluster is deleted and the Health Service and SDDC Management logs are no longer collected; however, existing data isn't deleted. If you'd like to delete that data, go into your DCR and Log Analytics workspace and delete the data manually.

### Update Insights

The Insights tile shows a **Needs update** message in the following cases:

- A data collection rule has changed.
- A health event from the Windows events log is deleted.
- Any of the five performance counters from the **Log Analytics** workspace are deleted.

To enable Insights again, do the following:

1. Select the **Insights** tile under **Capabilities**.

1. Select **Update** to see the visualizations again.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/update-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Update Insights window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/update-insights.png":::

### Migrate from the Microsoft Monitoring Agent

1. To migrate from the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to the Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA), scroll down to **Insights**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Install AMA window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration.png":::

1. Select **Install AMA**; the **Insights configuration** window opens.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Data collection rules window." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-2.png":::

1. Select or create a data collection rule as described previously in the [Enable Insights](#enable-insights) section.

The Azure Monitor Agent and the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension can both be installed on the same computer during migration. Running both agents might lead to duplication of data and increased cost. If a machine has both agents installed, you see a warning in the Azure portal that you might be collecting duplicate data, as shown below.

> [!WARNING]
> Collecting duplicate data from a single machine with both the Azure Monitor Agent and the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension can result in extra ingestion cost from sending duplicate data to the Log Analytics workspace.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a data duplication warning." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-3.png":::

You must remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension yourself from any computers that are using it. Before you do this step, ensure that the computer isn't relying on any other solutions that require the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.  After you verify that **MicrosoftMonitoringAgent** isn't still connected to your Log Analytics workspace, you can remove **MicrosoftMonitoringAgent** manually by redirecting to the **Extensions** page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you install AMA for Insights and uninstall MMA, Arc for Servers or VM Insights for individual cluster nodes will no longer work. If you would like to continue using Insights, Change tracking, Inventory, or other solutions relying on MMA for cluster nodes, we recommend that you install the MMA agent from the VM Insights page.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Extensions list." lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/agent-migration-4.png":::

### Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting steps, see [Troubleshooting guidance for the Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-troubleshoot-windows-arc).

# [Azure Stack HCI, version 21H2 and earlier](#tab/21h2-and-earlier)

Insights previously known as "monitoring", enables you to monitor your resources and provide useful insights regarding cluster, servers, virtual machines, storage, and much more.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/cluster-preview.png" alt-text="Cluster portal screen" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/cluster-preview.png":::

The data generated from your on-premises Azure Stack HCI cluster is collected in a Log Analytics workspace in Azure. Within that workspace, you can collect data about the health of your cluster. By default, monitoring collects the following logs every hour:

- Health Management (Microsoft-windows-health/operational)
- SDDC Management (Microsoft-Windows-SDDC-Management/Operational; Event ID: 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004)

To change the frequency of log collection, see [Event Log Channel](/azure-stack/hci/manage/monitor-hci-multi#event-log-channel).

### Prerequisites

To use Insights with the legacy Agent, make sure you've completed the following:

- Azure Stack HCI cluster should be [registered](../deploy/register-with-azure.md) with Azure and arc enabled. If you registered your cluster on or after June 15, 2021, this happens by default. Otherwise, you must enable [Azure Arc integration](../deploy/register-with-azure.md?enable-azure-arc-integration).

- [Enable Log Analytics](../deploy/register-with-azure.md) to link the cluster to a Log Analytics workspace where the log data required for monitoring will be saved.

- [Enable Insights](monitor-hci-single.md) to allow Azure Monitor to start collecting the events that are required for monitoring.

### Logs capability

After you register your cluster and Arc-enable the servers, you'll see the following in Azure portal:

- An Azure Stack HCI resource in the specified resource group.
- **Server - Azure Arc** resources for every server in the cluster in the `<clustername>ArcInstanceResourceGroup`.
- Nodes with a **Server-Azure Arc** resource link on the Azure Stack HCI resource page under the **Nodes** tab.

Now that your cluster nodes are Arc-enabled, navigate to your Azure Stack HCI cluster resource page. Under the **Capabilities** tab you see the option to enable logs, which should say **Not configured**.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/logs-capability.png" alt-text="Logs capability under the Capabilities tab" lightbox="media/monitor-azure-portal/logs-capability.png":::

This capability is an Arc for Servers extension that simplifies installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent. Because you're using the Arc for Servers extension to enable this workflow, if you ever add additional servers to your cluster, they'll automatically have the Microsoft Monitoring Agent installed on them.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Microsoft Monitoring Agent for Windows communicates outbound to the Azure Monitor service over TCP port 443. If the servers connect through a firewall or proxy server to communicate over the internet, review [these requirements](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent#network-requirements) to understand the network configuration required.

### Configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension

To configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (AMA) extension:

1. Under the **Capabilities** tab, select **Logs**.
2. Select **Use existing** to use the existing workspace for your subscription.
3. Select **Add** at the bottom of the page.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-log-analytics.png" alt-text="Enable Log Analytics on Azure portal" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-log-analytics.png":::

4. When the configuration is finished, **Logs** will appear as **Configured** under the **Capabilities** tab.
5. Select **Settings > Extensions** from the toolbar on the left. You should see that each of your servers has successfully installed the Microsoft Monitoring Agent.

You have now successfully installed the log analytics extension.

### Disable Log Analytics

If you'd like to disable the Logs capability, remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent from the **Extensions** settings. Note that this doesn't delete the Log Analytics workspace in Azure or any of the data that resides in it, so you must do that manually.

To remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent from every server in the cluster, follow these steps:

1. Select **Settings > Extensions** from the toolbar on the left.
2. Select the **MicrosoftMonitoringAgent** checkbox.
3. Select **Remove**, and then **Yes**.

### Enable Insights

Enabling Insights helps you monitor all Azure Stack HCI clusters currently associated with the Log Analytics workspace by providing useful health metrics. To enable this capability from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Under the **Capabilities** tab, select **Insights**. Then select **Get started**.
2. Insights should now show as **Configured** in the **Capabilities** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-insights.png" alt-text="Portal screen to enable Insights" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/enable-insights.png":::

### What data is collected?

The **Microsoft-windows-sddc-management/operational** and **microsoft-windows-health/operational** Windows event channel is added to your Log Analytics workspace under **Windows event logs**.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/windows-event-logs.png" alt-text="Portal workspace for Windows event logs" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/windows-event-logs.png":::

By collecting these logs, analytics will show the health status of the individual servers, drives, volumes, and VMs. By default, five performance counters will be added:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png" alt-text="Windows performance counters" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/performance-counters.png":::

#### Performance counters

The following table describes the performance counters that are monitored:

| Performance counters | Description |
|--|--|
| Memory(*)\Available Bytes | Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in bytes, immediately available for allocation to a process or for system use. |
| Network Interface(*)\Bytes Total/sec | The rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter, including framing characters. Bytes Total/sec is a sum of Bytes Received/sec and Bytes Sent/sec. |
| Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time | The percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. |
| RDMA Activity(*)\RDMA Inbound Bytes/sec | Rate of data received over RDMA by the network adapter per second. |
| RDMA Activity(*)\RDMA Outbound Bytes/sec | Rate of data sent over RDMA by the network adapter per second. |

After you enable Insights, it can take up to 15 minutes to collect the data. When the process is finished, you'll be able to see a rich visualization of the health of your cluster, under the **Insights** tab on the left navigation, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/server-health.png" alt-text="Server visualizations" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/server-health.png":::

### Disable Insights

To disable insights, follow these steps:

1. Select **Insights** under the **Capabilities** tab.
2. Select **Disable Insights**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/disable-insights.png" alt-text="Portal screen for disabling Insights" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/disable-insights.png":::

When you disable the Insights feature, the Health Service and SDDC Management logs are no longer collected; however, existing data isn't
deleted. If you'd like to delete that data, go into your Log Analytics workspace and delete the data manually.

### Update Insights

The Insights tile shows a **Needs update** message in the following cases:

- The health event from Windows events logs is deleted.
- Any or all of the 5 performance counters from the **Loganalytics** workspace are deleted.

To enable Insights again,

- Select the **Insights** tile under **Capabilities**.
- Select **Update** to see the visualizations again.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/needs-update.png" alt-text="Portal shows update needed" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/needs-update.png":::

### Troubleshooting

If the Logs capability and Monitoring capability are enabled without errors but the monitoring data doesn't appear after an hour or so, you can use the [Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-windows-troubleshoot).

#### How to use the Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool

1. Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator on the Azure Stack HCI host where the MicrosoftMonitoringAgent extension is installed.
2. Navigate to the directory where the tool is located.

   ```PowerShell
   cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Troubleshooter
   ```

3. Execute the main script using this command:

   ```PowerShell
   .\GetAgentInfo.ps1
   ```

4. When prompted to select a troubleshooting scenario, choose option 1: **Agent not reporting data or heartbeat data missing**.

5. You're prompted to select the action that you'd like to perform. Choose option **1: Diagnose**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-options-1.png" alt-text="Troubleshooting tool command line options" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-options-1.png":::

6. If you encounter the error that's highlighted in the following screenshot but are still able to connect to all Log Analytics endpoints and your firewall and gateway settings are correct, you have likely encountered a timezone issue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors.png" alt-text="Command prompt showing tool errors" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors.png":::

   The cause is that the local time is different than Azure time, and the workspace key couldn't be validated due to the mismatch.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors-prompt.png" alt-text="Move to next error" lightbox="media/monitor-hci-single/tool-errors-prompt.png":::

7. To resolve the issue:

   1. Go to your Azure Stack HCI resource page in Azure portal, select **[cluster name] > Extensions**. Then select the tick box for the MicrosoftMonitoringAgent extension and remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent extension.
   1. Ensure that your Azure Stack HCI host time zone is correct, and that the local time on the host is the same as Azure time for your time zone.
      1. From the Azure Stack HCI host console, select **option 9: Date & Time** from the **Sconfig** menu, then select **change time zone** and ensure local time is correct.
      1. Review the Active Directory PDC (Primary Domain Controller) time zone, and make sure the date and time are correct.
      1. If Active Directory PDC is correct and Azure Stack HCI local time is still incorrect, then the Active Directory domain hierarchy isn't being recognized. If so, complete steps iv - vi below. Otherwise, proceed to step c.
      1. From the Azure Stack HCI host,  select **option 15** to exit the **Sconfig menu**. Then run the following command in PowerShell as an administrator: `w32tm.exe /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update` - this should return a confirmation that the command completed successfully, and the time setting should now be correct.
      1. To diagnose further, run `w32tm /monitor` on the Azure Stack HCI host console. The active domain controller should be listed as stratum 1 server, and all other domain controllers as stratum 2.
      1. Lastly, ensure that the Windows time service and time providers aren't configured in a Group Policy Object, as this will interfere with the Active Directory domain hierarchy.
   1. Re-add the **Log Analytics** extension by going to your Azure Stack HCI resource page in Azure portal, select **[cluster name] > Overview**, then select **Capabilities** and configure Log Analytics and Monitoring.

8. Rerun the Log Analytics Troubleshooting Tool and you should no longer see the error. You should now see Windows agent numbers increment in your Log Analytics workspace under **Agents Management** to match your cluster nodes, and monitoring events begin to flow.
