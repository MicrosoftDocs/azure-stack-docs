> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local, version 23H2 is using the [Azure Arc control plane](../manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article is not yet provided by Azure Arc, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described below. Note that VMs created this way aren't Arc-enabled VMs. They have limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, such as no free use of Azure Update Manager.
