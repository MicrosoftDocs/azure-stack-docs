# Review requirements for Hyper-V VM migration to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article lists the system requirements for migrating Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) to Azure Stack HCI using Azure Migrate.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Supported operating systems

The following operating systems (OS) are supported for the source appliance, target appliance, and for the guest VMs that you are migrating.


|Component  |Supported OS |
|---------|---------|
|Source environment     |Hyper-V on Windows Server 2022<br>Hyper-V on Windows Server 2019<br>Hyper-V on Windows Server 2016<br>Hyper-V on Windows Server 2012 R2         |
|Source appliance     |Windows Server 2022        |
|Target environment     |Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2         |
|Target appliance     |Windows Server 2022         |
|Guest VM (Windows)    |Windows Server 2022<br>Windows Server 2019<br>Windows Server 2016<br>Windows Server 2012 R2<br>Windows Server 2008 R2*       |

*To migrate Windows Server 2008 R2 VMs, see the [FAQ](migrate-faq.yml).

## Supported geographies

You can create an Azure Migrate project in many geographies in the Azure public cloud. Here's a list of supported geographies for migration to Azure Stack HCI:

|Geography|Metadata storage locations|
|-|-|
|Asia-Pacific|South East Asia, East Asia|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|United States|East US, Central US, West Central US, West US2|

Keep in mind the following information as you create a project:

- The project geography is only used to store the discovered metadata.
- When you create a project, you select a geography. The project and related resources are created in one of the regions in the geography. The region is allocated by the Azure Migrate service. Azure Migrate doesn't move or store customer data outside of the region allocated.

## Azure portal requirements

For more information on Azure subscriptions and roles, see [Azure roles, Azure AD roles, and classic subscription administrator roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles).

|Level|Permissions|
|-|-|
|Tenant|Application administrator|
|Subscription|Contributor, User Access Administrator|

## Source Hyper-V server requirements

- Hyper-V server is supported for both standalone server and cluster configuration.

    You can discover and migrate standalone (non-highly available) VMs on standalone Hyper-V hosts. However, standalone VMs hosted on clustered Hyper-V hosts cannot be discovered or migrated. To migrate these VMs, they need to be [made highly available](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2013/01/how-to-make-an-existing-hyper-v-virtual-machine-highly-available/) first.

- The source server used for migration should have sufficient resources to create a Windows Server 2022 VM with this minimum of 16 GB memory, 80 GB disk, and 8 vCPUs.

- In this release, you can only migrate VMs that have disks attached to the cluster shared volumes (CSV). If the VM disks aren't attached to the CSV, the disks can't be migrated.

- Before you begin, for all Windows VMs, bring all the disks online and persist the drive letter. For more information, see how to [configure a SAN policy](/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration#configure-san-policy) to bring the disks online.

## Target Azure Stack HCI cluster requirements

- The target Azure Stack HCI cluster OS must be running version 23H2.

- An Arc Resource Bridge must exist on the Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 system for migration. The Arc Resource Bridge is automatically created during the deployment. To verify that an Arc Resource Bridge exists on your Azure Stack HCI system, see [Deploy using Azure portal](../deploy/deploy-via-portal.md).  

- Make sure that a logical network is configured on your Arc Resource Bridge. For more information, see [Create a logical network](../manage/create-logical-networks.md).

- Make sure that a custom storage path is configured on your Arc Resource Bridge for migration. For more information, see [Create a storage path](../manage/create-storage-path.md).

## Azure Migrate project requirements

Existing Azure Migrate customers that have already done VM discovery need to [create a new Azure Migrate project](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md#create-an-azure-migrate-project) for migration to Azure Stack HCI. You cannot use existing Azure Migrate projects for migration.
