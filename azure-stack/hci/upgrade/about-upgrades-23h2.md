# About Azure Stack HCI upgrades

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [end-of-service-22H2](../includes/end-of-service-22h2.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Consult your hardware OEM before you upgrade Azure Stack HCI. Validate that your OEM supports the version and the upgrade.

This article provides an overview of upgrading your existing Azure Stack HCI system from version 22H2 to version 23H2.

Throughout this article, we refer to Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 as the *new* version and Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 as the *old* version.

## About Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2

Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 is the latest version of the Azure Stack HCI solution. This version integrates the Azure Arc infrastructure that provisions and manages the workloads such as Arc VMs, Azure Kubernetes Services, and Azure Virtual Desktop. For more information, see [What's new in Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2](../whats-new.md#features-and-improvements-in-2311).

With version 23H2, Azure Stack HCI evolved from a cloud-connected operating system (OS) to an Arc-enabled solution. The OS forms the base layer of this solution, with the Arc and the Orchestrator (also known as the Lifecycle Manager) components layered on top. These components are packaged together into a solution that follows an [Infrastructure as code (IaC)](/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) model.

- This IaC model takes a set of input parameters that are specific to each customer and environment.
- The lifecycle manager then orchestrates the desired state across all the layers to meet the desired state and version.

The following diagram illustrates the components of an Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 system:

## Azure Stack HCI upgrade versus update

An upgrade is a whole new version of software that represents a significant change or major improvement. An update, on the other hand, is a process of applying a set of changes to the software to improve its performance, security, or stability.

Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2, is a whole new version of the solution with a multitude of new capabilities. To move from Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 to version 23H2, you need to upgrade your existing cluster. On the other hand, to ensure that you have the most recent features and security improvements for your current version of Azure Stack HCI, you would need to update your existing cluster.

## High-level steps for Azure Stack HCI upgrade

To upgrade your Azure Stack HCI from an old version, follow these high-level steps:

1. Upgrade the *old* OS to the *new* OS using one of the following methods:
    - [Via PowerShell (recommended)](./upgrade-22h2-to-23h2-powershell.md).
    - [Via Windows Admin Center](./upgrade-22h2-to-23h2-windows-admin-center.md).
    - [Via other manual methods](./upgrade-22h2-to-23h2-other-methods.md).

1. Perform post-OS upgrade tasks.

1. Validate the solution upgrade readiness.

1. Apply the solution upgrade.

The following diagram illustrates the Azure Stack HCI upgrade process:

## Supported workloads and configurations

Azure Stack HCI upgrade supports the following services and workloads:


|Workload/Configuration  |Currently supported  |
|---------|---------|
| Azure Kubernetes (AKS) on Azure Stack HCI     | See notes <br> Kubernetes versions are incompatible between Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2, and version 23H2. <br> Remove AKS and all the settings from AKS enabled by Azure Arc before you apply the solution upgrade.        |
| Arc VMs on Azure Stack HCI     | See notes <br> Preview versions of Arc VMs can't be upgraded.        |
| Stretched clusters on Azure Stack HCI     | No <br> The OS upgrade to 23H2 and the solution upgrade are unavailable for stretched clusters.      |
| System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)    | No <br> If your Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 cluster is managed by SCVMM, this upgrade process isn't currently supported. <br> For more information on System Center 2025 release and Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 support, see the [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/system-center-blog/announcement-system-center-2025-is-here/ba-p/4138510).         |
| Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2SP    | No <br> This upgrade process isn't supported for upgrading from Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 Supplemental Package clusters.        |
