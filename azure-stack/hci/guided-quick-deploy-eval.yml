    > This guide is for evaluation purposes only. **It SHOULD NOT be used for a production environment.**

    This guide shows you how to quickly deploy and evaluate a virtualized Azure Stack HCI cluster with **no hardware investment**. You'll deploy a Windows Server 2022 DC Azure virtual machine (VM), which uses [Hyper-V nested-virtualization](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization) to host the following VMs:  
       - one VM running Windows Server 2019 DC, which serves as the management VM and hosts Windows Admin Center and an Active Directory domain controller
       - two VMs running Azure Stack HCI 21H2, which are the servers that will form the Azure Stack HCI cluster and host the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure

    **Prerequisites**

    Before beginning, make sure you have:

    1. **An Azure subscription capable of deploying Azure VMs with at least 16 virtual CPUs**. If you don't, you have two options that support the Azure VM requirements:  
        - If you have a Visual Studio subscription, [Activate your Azure credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/).  
        - Sign up for a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), then [upgrade it to pay-as-you-go](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription). The upgrade to pay-as-you-go is required  
          in order to host the VM size required for this evaluation, and gives you 30 days to use the $200 credit from the free subscription.  
    2. **An Azure account capable of accessing:**  
        - your Azure subscription using [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) membership in:
          - either the "Owner" role (you'll already be a member if you created the subscription)  
          - or the "User Access Administrator" and "Contributor" roles  
        - your Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant using [Azure AD RBAC](/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-overview) membership in:
          - either the "Global Administrator" role (you'll already be a member if you created the subscription)  
          - or the "Cloud application administrator" role  
    3. **A basic understanding of [how to use the Azure portal](/azure/azure-portal/)**, in particular creating and connecting to a VM.  

- title: Deploy the Azure VM
  durationInMinutes: 45
  content: |

    First you deploy an Azure VM to simulate a physical server. The VM will be completely configured, with Windows Server, Hyper-V, networking components, and storage. Later you'll deploy nested VMs for the two Azure Stack HCI nodes, and an additional VM to host a Windows domain controller and Windows Admin Center.

    1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button to sign in to the Azure portal, and proceed with the Azure VM deployment:

       > [!TIP] 
       > Hold down **CTRL** while selecting the button to open the Azure portal in a new browser tab.

       [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FAzStackHCISandbox%2Fmain%2Fjson%2Fazuredeploy.json "Deploy to Azure")

    1. In the Azure portal, you're presented with the **Custom deployment** form: 
       
       1. Under **Resource group**, select **Create new**, for example "HciEval".
       1. Select an Azure **Region** for your VM and verify that "Standard_E16s_v4" is selected for **Virtual Machine Size** 
       1. Specify an **Admin Password**.
       1. If you have [Software Assurance Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit), select "Yes" for **Already Have a Windows Server License**.
       1. Select **Next: Review + create >**.

       >[!IMPORTANT]
       > A VM with at least 16 cores, 64-GB memory, nested virtualization, and Premium Storage is required. Temp storage isn't required.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/deploy-arm-details-50.png" alt-text="Deploy ARM template details" lightbox="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/deploy-arm-details.png" :::

    1. On the **Review + create** tab, you should see a "Validation passed" message at the top. Select the **Create** button to continue with deployment. 

       >[!NOTE]
       > If validation fails with *The requested size for resource \<resource\> is currently not available in location \<region\> zones*, return to the **Basics** tab and select a [region that supports the Esv4-series VM size](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines).

       :::image type="content" source="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/deploy-arm-review-create.png" alt-text="Deploy ARM template review" lightbox="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/deploy-arm-review-create.png" :::

    1. Next you'll see a **Deployment is in progress" page**. Deployment typically takes around 45 minutes.

- title: Deploy the Azure Stack HCI cluster
  durationInMinutes: 110
  content: |

    After you've remoted into the Azure VM, finalize your deployment by running a PowerShell script to provision the Azure Stack HCI and management VMs and create the Azure Stack HCI cluster. The VMs are hosted on the Azure VM using nested virtualization:  

    1. Minimize or close the **Server Manager** app. On the desktop, you'll see a **New-AzSHCISandbox** shortcut icon which will open a PowerShell console to run the script: 

       > [!NOTE]
       > Desired State Configuration may still be running in the background, configuring files and deployment scripts. Once complete, the **New-AzSHCISandbox** shortcut icon will appear on the desktop.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/azure-vm-desktop-2.png" alt-text="RDP Windows Server desktop" lightbox="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/azure-vm-desktop-large-2.png" :::

    1. To keep the PowerShell console window open after the script finishes, see the following Tip. When ready, double-click the **New-AzSHCISandbox** shortcut to run the cluster deployment script.

       > [!TIP]
       > To keep the PowerShell console window open after the script finishes, right-click the shortcut icon and select **Properties**, then copy the following command and replace the **Target** property. This can be useful if you encounter errors during deployment.
       > 
       > ```console
       > PowerShell -NoExit C:\AzHCI_Sandbox\AzSHCISandbox-main\New-AzSHCISandbox.ps1
       > ```

    1. The PowerShell script typically runs for about 1 hour and 50 minutes. When complete, you'll see a "Successfully deployed the Azure Stack HCI Sandbox" message:

       :::image type="content" source="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/azure-vm-ps-cluster-deploy.png" alt-text="Run the cluster deployment script" lightbox="./media/guided-quick-deploy-eval/azure-vm-ps-cluster-deploy.png" :::

- title: Register with Azure
  durationInMinutes: 20
  content: |

    Now you'll integrate your cluster with Azure by completing the [Azure registration process using Windows Admin Center](/azure-stack/hci/deploy/register-with-azure#register-a-cluster-using-windows-admin-center), which includes:
    - registering Windows Admin Center with Azure
    - registering the Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure          

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You'll need an Azure account to sign in during registration. For the easiest experience the account should have membership in the following roles:
    >
    > [Azure RBAC roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) on the subscription:
    > - Either membership in the "Owner" role (you'll already be a member if you created the subscription)  
    > - Or membership in the "User Access Administrator" and "Contributor" roles  
    >
    > [Azure AD RBAC roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-overview) on the Azure AD tenant:
    > - Either "Global Administrator" (you'll already be a member if you created the subscription)  
    > - or "Cloud application administrator"  
    >
    > **If you don't have an account with the appropriate permissions**, you'll need to work with an administrator that can either:
    > - Complete this entire registration section for you
    > - Or allow you to proceed with registration, but be available to provide permissions consent as necessary during the flow

    1. Return to the **Cluster Manager** **Dashboard** view, where you'll see a status of **Not yet registered** under **Azure connection**. Select the **Register this cluster** link to begin the first part of the registration process, which registers your Windows Admin Center gateway with Azure:
