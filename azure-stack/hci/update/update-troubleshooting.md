# Troubleshoot Azure Stack HCI solution update (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../../includes/hci-applies-to-supplemental-package.md)]

This article describes how to troubleshoot solution updates that are applied to your Azure Stack HCI cluster to keep it up-to-date.

[!INCLUDE [important](../../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## About troubleshooting updates

The Lifecycle Manager includes retry and remediation logic. This logic attempts to fix update issues in a non-disruptive way, such as retrying a CAU run. If an update run can't be remediated automatically, it fails. When an update fails, you can retry the update. 

## Collect update logs

You can also collect diagnostic logs to help Microsoft identify and fix the issues. To collect logs for the update failures, follow these steps on the client that you're using to access your cluster:

1. Establish a remote PowerShell session with the server node. Run PowerShell as administrator and run the following command:
    ```powershell
    Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <server_IP_address>  -Credential <username\password for the server>
    ```
2. Get all the solutions updates and then filter the solution updates corresponding to a specific version. The version used corresponds to the version of solution update that failed to install.
    ```powershell
    $Update = Get-SolutionUpdate| ? version -eq "<Version string>" -verbose
    ```
3. Identify the action plan for the failed solution update run.
    ```powershell
    $Failure = $update|Get-SolutionUpdateRun
    ```
4. Identify the `ResourceID` for the Update.
    ```powershell
    $Failure
    ```
    Here's a sample output:
    
    ```output
    PS C:\Users\lcmuser> $Update = Get-SolutionUpdate| ? version -eq "10.2303.1.7" -verbose
    PS C:\Users\lcmuser> $Failure = $Update|Get-SolutionUpdateRun
    PS C:\Users\lcmuser> $Failure
    
    ResourceId      : redmond/Solution10.2303.1.7/2c21b859-e063-4f24-a4db-bc1d6be82c4e
    Progress        : Microsoft.AzureStack.Services.Update.ResourceProvider.UpdateService.Models.Step
    TimeStarted     : 4/21/2023 10:02:54 PM
    LastUpdatedTime : 4/21/2023 3:19:05 PM
    Duration        : 00:16:37.9688878
    State           : Failed
    ```
    Note the `ResourceID` GUID. This corresponds to the `ActionPlanInstanceID`.

5. Copy the logs for the `ActionPlanInstanceID` that you noted earlier, to a text file named *log.txt*. Use Notepad to open the text file.

    ```powershell
    Get-ActionplanInstance -ActionplanInstanceId <Action Plan Instance ID> >log.txt
    notepad log.txt
    ```
    Here's sample output:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\lcmuser> Get-ActionplanInstance -actionplaninstanceid 2c21b859-e063-4f24-a4db-bc1d6be82c4e >log.txt
    
    PS C:\Users\lcmuser>notepad log.txt
    ```
