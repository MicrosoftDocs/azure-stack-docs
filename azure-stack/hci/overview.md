## Management tools and System Center

Azure Stack HCI uses the same virtualization and software-defined storage and networking software as Azure Stack Hub. However, with Azure Stack HCI you have full admin rights on the cluster and can manage any of its technologies directly:

- [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-on-windows-server)
- [Storage Spaces Direct](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview)
- [Software Defined Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/sdn/)
- [Failover Clustering](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview)

To manage these technologies, you can use the following management tools:

- [Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/overview)
- [System Center](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/system-center)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/?view=powershell-6)
- Other management tools, like [Server Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/server-manager/server-manager), and MMC snap-ins
- Non-Microsoft tools like 5Nine Manager

If you choose to use System Center to deploy and manage your infrastructure, you'll use System Center Virtual Machine Management (VMM) and System Center Operations Manager. With VMM, you provision and manage the resources needed to create and deploy VMs and services to private clouds. With Operations Manager, you monitor services, devices, and operations across your enterprise to identify problems for immediate action.
