- To enable Azure Arc VMs on your Azure Stack HCI, see [Deploying Azure Arc resource bridge](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview#azure-arc-resource-bridge-deployment-overview). As a part of Arc Resource Bridge deployment, you'll also create a custom location for your Azure Stack HCI cluster that you'll use later in the scenario. The custom location will also show up in the **Overview** page for Azure Stack HCI cluster.
