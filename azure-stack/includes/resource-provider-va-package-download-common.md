Before installing or updating a resource provider, you must download the required packages to the Azure Stack Hub marketplace. The download process varies, depending on whether your Azure Stack Hub instance is connected to the Internet, or disconnected.

> [!NOTE]
> The download process can take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the network latency and existing packages on your Azure Stack Hub instance.
