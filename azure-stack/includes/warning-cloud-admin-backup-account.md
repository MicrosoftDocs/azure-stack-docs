> [!Warning]  
> By default your Azure Stack Hub stamp is configured with only one [CloudAdmin account](../operator/azure-stack-manage-basics.md#what-account-should-i-use). There are no recovery options if the account credentials are lost, compromised, or locked. **You will lose access to the privileged endpoint and other resources**. 
>  
> **It is *highly* recommended that you [create additional CloudAdmin accounts](../reference/pep/new-cloudadminuser.md), to avoid redeployment of your stamp at your own expense.**
