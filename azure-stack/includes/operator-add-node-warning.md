> [!WARNING]  
> Azure Stack Hub requires that the configuration of all servers in the solution have the same configuration, including for example CPU (model, cores), memory quantity, NIC and link speeds, and storage devices. Azure Stack Hub does not support a change in CPU models during hardware replacement or when adding a scale unit node. a change in CPU, such as an upgrade, will require uniform CPUs in each scale unit node and a redeployment of Azure Stack Hub.
