- You've your Microsoft account with credentials to access Azure portal.

- You've access to an Azure Stack HCI cluster. This cluster is deployed, registered, and connected to Azure Arc.

   - Go to the **Overview** page in the Azure Stack HCI cluster resource. On the **Server** tab in the right-pane, the **Azure Arc** should show as **Connected**.

- To enable Azure Arc VMs on your Azure Stack HCI, see [Deploying Azure Arc resource bridge](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview#azure-arc-resource-bridge-deployment-overview). As a part of Arc Resource Bridge deployment, you'll also create a custom location for your Azure Stack HCI cluster that you'll use later in the scenario. The custom location will also show up in the **Overview** page for Azure Stack HCI cluster.

- For custom images in Azure Storage account, you'll have the following extra prerequisites:

    - You should have a VHD loaded in your Azure Storage account. See how to [Upload a VHD image in your Azure Storage account](/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-create-virtual-machine-image?tabs=windows#copy-vhd-to-storage-account-using-azcopy).
    - The container and the blob associated with the custom image must have anonymous read access if using Blob URL to specify as the image path. For more information, see how to [Change the access level for the container in your Storage account](/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure?tabs=portal#set-the-public-access-level-for-a-container). If you don't want to change the container access, you'll need to use the Blob SAS URI. For more information, see how to [Get the Blob SAS URI](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/create-sas-tokens#use-the-azure-portal).

    - The VHDX image must be Gen 2 type and secure boot enabled.
    - The VHDX image must be prepared using `sysprep /generalize /shutdown /oobe`. For more information, see [Sysprep command-line options](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep-command-line-options?view=windows-11#oobe&preserve-view=true).
