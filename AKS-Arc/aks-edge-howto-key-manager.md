# How-to: use Key Manager for Kubernetes on an AKS Edge Essentials cluster (preview)

The [Kubernetes service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) is a a non-human account that provides a unique identity within a Kubernetes cluster. Service account tokens serve important security and authentication functions in Kubernetes.

In AKS Edge Essentials, *service account tokens* enable workload pods to authenticate and access Azure resources through [*workload identity federation*](aks-edge-workload-identity.md). Key Manager for Kubernetes is an Azure Arc extension that automates the rotation of the signing key used to issue these service account tokens. The rotation reduces the risk of token misuse and improves the overall security posture of the cluster.

The following table compares the default behavior with and without using the Key Manager for Kubernetes extension:

|   Behavior                              | By default, without the Key Manager extension                                                                                                | With the Key Manager extension                                                        |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated service account key rotation | By default, Kubernetes doesn't automatically rotate service account signing keys. Instead, it uses the same key indefinitely to sign tokens. | Once enabled, the service account signing key is rotated automatically every 45 days. |
| Service account signing key validity   | Unlimited                                                                                                                                    | 47 days                                                                               |

Azure Kubernetes Service Edge Essentials previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis.

> [!NOTE]
> During the preview, the Key Manager for Kubernetes is only available for AKS Edge Essentials K3s version 1.30.6 or later single control plane node deployments with Arc connectivity. It's not compatible with other Arc-enabled Kubernetes distributions.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AKS Edge Essentials K3s cluster with Arc connectivity. If you plan to use Azure IoT Operations with AKS Edge Essentials, follow this [Quickstart guide](aks-edge-howto-deploy-azure-iot.md#create-an-arc-enabled-cluster) to create your cluster.
- To enable TLS for intracluster log communication, the `cert-manager` and `trust-manager` tools are required.
  - If you plan to [use Azure IoT Operations](/azure/iot-operations/get-started-end-to-end-sample/quickstart-deploy#deploy-azure-iot-operations), deploy it before installing the Key Manager for Kubernetes extension, since Azure IoT Operations installs its own copy of these applications by default.
  - To verify if `cert-manager` and `trust-manager` are installed, run the following command::

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
    ```

    If they are installed, you can see their pods in a running state.

  - If `cert-manager` and `trust-manager` are not present, follow the documentation to:

    1. Install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
    1. Install [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/trust-manager/installation/). While installing trust manager, set the `trust namespace` to `cert-manager`. For example:

       ```bash
       helm upgrade trust-manager jetstack/trust-manager --install --namespace cert-manager --set app.trust.namespace=cert-manager --wait
       ```

       `trust-manager` is used to distribute a trust bundle to components.

- The Key Manager extension only works with [bounded service account tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#manual-secret-management-for-serviceaccounts). It doesn't support legacy tokens with infinite lifetimes. If your workflow relies on legacy tokens, do not install this extension.
- Bounded service account tokens have a default lifetime of one year. To rotate these tokens, this lifetime should be reduced to one day, which ensures that tokens are rapidly reissued and signed with newly rotated keys. To implement these changes, you must modify the `api-server` configuration by running the following commands:

  ```powershell
  $url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/refs/heads/main/tools/scripts/AksEdgeKeyManagerExtension/UpdateK3sConfigForKeyManager.ps1"
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile .\UpdateK3sConfigForKeyManager.ps1
  Unblock-File .\UpdateK3sConfigForKeyManager.ps1
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
   
  .\UpdateK3sConfigForKeyManager.ps1
  ```

## Install the Key Manager for Kubernetes extension for service account key rotation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you install the Key Manager extension, the `api-server` is updated with the new service account token during token rotation. This process briefly makes the API server inaccessible while it restarts.

Now run the following commands. Replace the variables with your specific resource group name and AKS cluster name:

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
New-AzKubernetesExtension -SubscriptionId $yoursubscriptionID -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name -ClusterName $aks_cluster_name -ClusterType connectedClusters -Name "MySAkeymanager" -ExtensionType microsoft.arc.kuberneteskeymanager
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

```azurecli
az k8s-extension create -g $resource_group_name -c $aks_cluster_name -t connectedClusters -n "MySAkeymanager" --extension-type microsoft.arc.kuberneteskeymanager 
```

---

After you install the extension, you can view the **MySAkeymanager** extension in the Azure portal under the **Settings/Extensions** section of your Kubernetes cluster.

## Remove key manager for Kubernetes extension

You can uninstall the Key Manager extension using the [az k8s-extension delete](/cli/azure/k8s-extension#az-k8s-extension-delete) command:

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Remove-AzKubernetesExtension -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name -ClusterName $aks_cluster_name -ClusterType connectedClusters -Name "MySAkeymanager"
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

```azurecli
az k8s-extension delete -g $resource_group_name -c $aks_cluster_name -t connectedClusters -n "MySAkeymanager"
```

## Working with Azure IoT Operations

If you installed the Key Manager for Kubernetes extension before you deployed Azure IoT Operations, you must follow the [Bring your own issuer](/azure/iot-operations/secure-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca#bring-your-own-issuer) instructions, as Azure IoT Operations installs `cert-manager` and `trust-manager` by default.
