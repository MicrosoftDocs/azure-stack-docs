# Can't create AKS cluster or scale node pool because of issues with AKS Arc images

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

## Symptoms

You see the following error when you try to create the AKS cluster:

```output
Kubernetes version 1.29.4 is not ready for use on Linux. Please go to https://aka.ms/aksarccheckk8sversions for details of how to check the readiness of Kubernetes versions.
```

You might also see the following error when you try to scale a nodepool:

```output
error with code NodepoolPrecheckFailed occured: AksHci nodepool creation precheck failed. Detailed message: 1 error occurred:\n\t* rpc error: code = Unknown desc = GalleryImage not usable, health state degraded: Degraded
```

When you run `az aksarc get-versions`, you see the following errors:

```output
...
              {

                "errorMessage": "failed cloud-side provisioning image linux-cblmariner-0.4.1.11203 to cloud gallery: {\n  \"code\": \"ImageProvisionError\",\n  \"message\": \"force failed to deprovision existing gallery image: failed to delete gallery image linux-cblmariner-0.4.1.11203: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = sa659p1012: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \\\"transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp 10.202.244.4:45000: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.\\\"\",\n  \"additionalInfo\": [\n   {\n    \"type\": \"providerImageProvisionInfo\",\n    \"info\": {\n     \"ProviderDownload\": \"True\"\n    }\n   }\n  ],\n  \"category\": \"\"\n }",
