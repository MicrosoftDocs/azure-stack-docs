# What's new in AKS on Azure Local

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article lists the various features and improvements that are available in AKS enabled by Azure Arc on Azure Local.

> [!NOTE]
> AKS on Azure Local is only supported on Azure Local version 23H2 and later.

## Features and improvements

This section lists the new features and improvements in AKS Arc in each release of Azure Local.

### Release 2507

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Linux 2.0 (formerly CBL-Mariner) will reach its official end of life (EOL) on July 31, 2025. After this date, Azure Linux will no longer receive updates, security patches, or support from the Azure Linux team. Starting with the [Azure Local 2507 release](/azure/azure-local/whats-new), AKS on Azure Local will release Azure Linux 3.0 images for all supported Kubernetes versions. To maintain security compliance and ensure continued support, you should migrate to [Azure Linux 3.0](/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux#whats-new-with-azure-linux-30) as soon as possible, by upgrading Azure Local instances to the 2507 release.
>
> Support for Kubernetes minor version 1.28 will end on August 31, 2025. We will introduce Kubernetes 1.31 in the next Azure Local release.

The following Kubernetes cluster deployment and management capabilities are available:

- **Disk space exhaustion**: Fixed [issues due to disk space exhaustion on control plane VMs due to accumulation of kube-apiserver audit logs](kube-apiserver-log-overflow.md).  
- **Cluster upgrade**: Fixed AKS Arc cluster and node pool create, scale, and [upgrade issues due to unavailability of AKS Arc VM images](gallery-image-not-usable.md).
- **New checks**: Added new checks during cluster and node pool operations. These improvements allow the system to proactively detect and handle scenarios where there are insufficient IP addresses in the IP pool.
- **GPU resource allocation**: Additional pre-checks for resource allocation for GPUs during Kubernetes cluster create operation.
- **Node pool improvements**: Accurate representation of node pool count and status on the Azure portal. This release also includes improvements to node pool creation and update flows to ensure that the Kubernetes cluster status accounts for corresponding node pool status.
- **Improvements to autoscaler capabilities**:
  - Fixed an issue in which secrets were updated repeatedly when the autoscaler was enabled. The fix ensures that the provider checks for an existing secret and only creates it if it's missing.
  - Fixed an issue in which users were unable to disable the autoscaler at the Kubernetes cluster level.
  - Improved conflict handling logic during cluster delete operations when the autoscaler or cluster controller tried to update or remove resources that were being changed simultaneously by another process.
  - Fixed an issue in which the node pools' minimum and maximum counts didn't get updated when the autoscaler was enabled.

#### Supported Kubernetes versions for 2507

The Kubernetes versions supported in the 2507 release are: 1.28.12, 1.28.14, 1.29.7, 1.29.9, 1.30.3, and 1.30.4.  

### Release 2503

The following Kubernetes cluster deployment and management capabilities are available:

- **Large VM SKUs for Kubernetes node pools**: Added two new VM SKUs - `Standard_D32s_v3`: 32 vCPU, 128 GiB and `Standard_D16s_v3`: 16 vCPU, 64 GiB - to support larger node pools on an AKS cluster. For more information about supported VM sizes, see [supported scale options](scale-requirements.md).
- **Improved log collection experience**: Improved log collection for AKS control plane node VMs and node pool VMs, with support for passing multiple IP addresses and SSH key or directory path. For more information, see [on-demand log collection](get-on-demand-logs.md) and [az aksarc get-logs CLI](/cli/azure/aksarc#az-aksarc-get-logs).
- **Improved diagnosability**: The [Diagnostic Checker tool](aks-arc-diagnostic-checker.md) is automatically run if the Kubernetes cluster creation fails, and added new test cases.
- **Improved Kubernetes cluster delete**: Fixed deletion issues; for example, due to [pod disruption budgets](delete-cluster-pdb.md?tabs=aks-on-azure-local).
- **Improved AKS Arc image download**: Fixed issues with AKS Arc image downloads.
- **Improved GPU support**: Improved error handling for Kubernetes cluster creation with GPU enabled node pools. Fixed known issues with attaching persistent volumes on GPU enabled node pools.

To get started with these features in the 2503 release, make sure to update your [AKSArc CLI extension](/cli/azure/aksarc) to version 1.5.37 or higher.

#### Supported Kubernetes versions for 2503

The Kubernetes versions supported in the 2503 release are: 1.28.12, 1.28.14, 1.29.7, 1.29.9, 1.30.3 and 1.30.4.
