# Use the Support Tool to troubleshoot and fix AKS Arc related issues

The [**Support Tool**](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Support.AksArc) is a PowerShell module that provides diagnostic and remediation capabilities for AKS Arc environments. Before you open a support request, you can run the specified commands in this module to help diagnose and potentially resolve issues. 

## Benefits

The Support Tool uses simple commands to identify issues without expert product knowledge. The tool provides:

- **Fixes for installation and upgrade issues**: Identifies and attempts to remediate common issues that occur during the installation and upgrade process.
- **Diagnostic checks**: Provides diagnostic health checks based on common issues, incidents, and telemetry data.
- **Enables Windows node pool feature**: Allows users to enable Windows node pools and download the required VHDs before creating Windows node pools.
- **Regular updates**: Updates with new checks and useful commands to manage, troubleshoot, and diagnose issues in AKS Arc.

## Common issues where the Support tool might help

You should run the commands if you experience any of the following symptoms:

- Solution upgrade fails in MOC binaries state.
- Solution upgrade fails in Arc Resource Bridge stage.
- MOC service doesn't stay online.
- Arc Resource Bridge is offline.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that:

- You have access to an Azure Local system that runs 2311 or higher. The system should be registered with Azure.
- You have access to a client that can connect to your Azure Local.

## Connect to your Azure Local instance

Follow these steps on your client to connect to one of the machines in your Azure Local.

1. Run PowerShell as an administrator on the client that you use to connect to your system.
1. Open a remote PowerShell session to a machine on your Azure Local instance. Run the following command and provide the credentials for your machine when prompted:

   ```powershell
   $cred = Get-Credential
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<Azure Local node IP>" -Credential $cred 
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Sign in using your deployment user account credentials. This is the account you created when preparing [Active Directory](/azure/azure-local/deploy/deployment-prep-active-directory) and used to deploy Azure Local.

   Here's an example output:

   ```Console
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> $cred = Get-Credential
    Â 
   cmdlet Get-Credential at command pipeline position 1
   Supply values for the following parameters:
   Credential
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "100.100.100.10" -Credential $cred 
   [100.100.100.10]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
   ```

   </details>

## Installation

To install the Support Tool module, run the following commands:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Support.AksArc
Import-Module Support.AksArc -force
```

If you already have the module installed, you can update it using the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name Support.AksArc
```

>[!NOTE]
>When you import the module, it attempts to automatically update it from the PowerShell gallery. You can also update manually using the following methods.

Ensure that you have the latest module loaded into the current instance by removing and importing the module:

```powershell
Remove-Module -Name Support.AksArc
Import-Module -Name Support.AksArc
```

## Use the AKS Arc Support Tool

This section provides examples of the different cmdlets available in the Support Tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to run these PowerShell commands locally, not in a PowerShell remote session.

### View available cmdlets

To see a list of available cmdlets in the PowerShell module, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module Support.AksArc
```

### Perform diagnostic checks

You can perform a diagnostic health check against the system to help detect common issues:

```powershell
Test-SupportAksArcKnownIssues
```

The following example output from the `Test-SupportAksArcKnownIssues` command shows the results of a failed test:

```output
