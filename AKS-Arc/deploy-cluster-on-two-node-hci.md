# Availability scenarios for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Windows Server on two-node Azure Local

[!INCLUDE [aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

This article describes the architecture for deploying a Kubernetes cluster on a two-node Azure Local cluster. The article describes various failure scenarios that can occur, their impact on the cluster, and recoverability from these failure scenarios.

## Architecture

Traditional Kubernetes deployments require three physical machines to mitigate a single failure. This requirement usually means a higher Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). For cost-sensitive deployments, AKS on Windows Server can be deployed on a two-node Azure Local system, as shown below, with a few trade-offs in availability. These trade-offs are described in [Availability scenarios and their impact on two-node AKS cluster](#availability-scenarios-and-their-impact-on-two-node-aks-cluster).

For more information about architecture, cluster deployment strategies, reliability considerations, and cost optimization for AKS, see [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) baseline architecture](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/hybrid/aks-baseline).

## Terminology

This article uses the following terminology:

| Term                | Definition                                                                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Azure Local Host   | The physical Azure Local cluster node that hosts the VMs needed to run AKS on Windows Server. |
| Guest OS            | Operating system running inside the control plane virtual machine (VM), load balancer VM, or node pool VMs. |
| Failover Clustering | Failover Clustering for Azure Local and Windows Server provides infrastructure features that support high availability of VMs and applications. If a cluster node or service fails, the VMs or applications that are hosted on that node can be automatically or manually transferred to another available node in a process known as **failover**. |
| Workload cluster    | A Kubernetes cluster that is deployed by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to host the containerized end-user application or workload, also known as a **target cluster**. |
| Management cluster (AKS host) | Provides the core orchestration mechanism and interface for deploying and managing one or more workload clusters. The management cluster contains a single control plane VM. |
| Load balancer       | A single dedicated Linux VM with a load-balancing rule for the API server. |
| API server          | Enables interaction with the Kubernetes cluster, providing interaction for management tools such as Windows Admin Center, PowerShell modules, and `kubectl`. |
| CRUD                | Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. |

## Availability scenarios and their impact on two-node AKS cluster

The scaled-down architecture in an Azure Local deployment with two physical nodes involves some availability trade-offs. This section describes node behavior during the following failure modes and during updates:

- [Updates](#updates)
- [Host hardware failure](#hardware-failure-on-host)
- [Host OS failure](#host-os-failure)
- [Management plane VM failure](#management-plane-vm-failure)
- [Control plane VM failure](#control-plane-vm-failure)
- [Node pool (worker node) failure](#node-pool-worker-nodes-vm-failure)
- [Load balancer VM failure](#load-balancer-vm-failure)
