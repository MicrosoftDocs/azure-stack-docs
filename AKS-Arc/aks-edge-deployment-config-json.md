# Deployment configuration JSON parameters

This page describes the AKS Edge Essentials deployment schema used in the `aksedge-config.json`.

You can find the complete JSON schema file at `C:\Program Files\AksEdge\aksedge-dcschema.json`.

| Attribute | Value type      |  Description |  Default value |   Applicable deployment types   |
| :------------ |:-----------|:------------------|:--------|:------------|
| `SchemaVersion` |String|Specifies the version of the schema/format of the JSON. | `1.9` |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Version` |`1.0`|Specifies the version of the JSON instance. | `1.0` |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `DeploymentType` |[`SingleMachineCluster` / `ScalableCluster`]| Specifies deployment type. In `ScalableCluster`, you can add more machines to the cluster infrastructure. | `SingleMachineCluster` |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Init.ServiceIPRangeStart` |IPv4 address `A.B.C.x`.|Reserved IP start address for your Kubernetes services. This IP range must be free on your subnet **A.B.C.0**.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Init.ServiceIPRangeSize` |`[0-127]`|Number of reserved IP start addresses for your Kubernetes services. Based on the size, we allocate a range of free IP addresses on your subnet. | `0` |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Init.KmsPlugin.Enable` | Boolean | Specifies whether the KMS plugin is enabled or not. | false | Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Join.ClusterJoinToken` |String|`Reserved` | None |Full deployment only|
| `Join.DiscoveryTokenHash` |String|`Reserved`| None |Full deployment only|
| `Join.CertificateKey` |String|`Reserved`| None |Full deployment only|
| `Join.ClusterId` |String|`Reserved`| None |Full deployment only|
| `Arc.ClusterName` |String|Preferred name for the cluster to show in the Azure portal.| `<Machinename>-cluster` |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.Location` |String|Location of resource group.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.ResourceGroupName` |String|Resource group name.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.SubscriptionId` |GUID|Azure subscription ID.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.TenantId` |GUID| TenantID for the Azure subscription.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.ClientId` |GUID| AppID of the service principal. You can use the **App Registrations** page in the Microsoft Entra resource page on the Azure portal, to list and manage the service principals in a tenant.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Arc.ClientSecret` |String|Secret associated with the service principal.| None |Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Network.ControlPlaneEndpointIp` |IPv4 address `A.B.C.x`|A free IP address on your subnet **A.B.C**. The control plane (API server) gets this address. |  |Full deployment only|
| `Network.NetworkPlugin` |[`calico` / `flannel`]|CNI plugin choice for the Kubernetes network model. For K8s cluster, always use `calico` and for K3s cluster, always use `flannel`.|  `flannel`|Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Network.Ip4GatewayAddress` |IPv4 address `A.B.C.x`|Gateway address; typically the router address.|    |Full deployment only|
| `Network.Ip4PrefixLength` |`[1-31]`|The IP address subnet **A.B.C** prefix length. For example, use **24** if your network is **192.168.1.0/24**.| `24`|Full deployment only|
| `Network.Ip4AddressPrefix` |Subnet mask `A.B.C.0/24`|The subnet from which IP addresses are allotted in single machine deployments. For example, if you specify **192.168.1.0/24**, then the gateway address is **192.168.1.1**, the Linux node is **192.168.1.2**, the Windows node is **192.168.1.3**, and the service IPs are assigned **192.168.1.4** and onwards. This parameter is optional, and you must ensure that the IP addresses are available for use. If this parameter is not specified, AKS Edge Essentials determines available IP addresses on a best effort basis.  | |Single machine deployment only|
| `Network.DnsServers` |IPv4 address `A.B.C.x` |IP address of your DNS (typically the router address). To view what DNS your machine uses, issue the command `Get-DnsClientServerAddress -AddressFamily IPv4`.  | |Full deployment only|
| `Network.InternetDisabled` |Boolean|Whether your cluster has access to the internet. The default is `false`, meaning your cluster by default has access to the internet.|  `false`|Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Network.SkipAddressFreeCheck` |Boolean|Ignores IP Address check failures and continues with deployment.|  `false`|Full deployment|
| `Network.SkipDnsCheck` |Boolean|If you have provided DNS servers in the `Network.DnsServers` parameter, this flag ignores the DNS check and continues with deployment.| `false`|Single-machine and full deployment|
| `Network.Proxy.Http` |String | HttpProxy link. ||Single-machine and full deployment|
