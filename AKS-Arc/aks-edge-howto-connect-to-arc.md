# Connect your AKS Edge Essentials cluster to Arc

This article describes how to connect your AKS Edge Essentials cluster to [Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) so that you can monitor the health of your cluster on the Azure portal. If your cluster is connected to a proxy, you can use the scripts provided in the GitHub repo to connect your cluster to Arc [as described here](./aks-edge-howto-more-configs.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with the AKS Edge Essentials 1.10.868.0 release, the `Arc` section of the config file is required. The Azure Arc connection occurs automatically after you run `New-AksEdgeDeployment` to deploy an AKS Edge Essentials cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Before connecting to Arc, infrastructure administrators who are the owner or contributor role of the subscription will have to:
  1. Enable all required resource providers in the Azure subscription, such as **Microsoft.HybridCompute**, **Microsoft.GuestConfiguration**, **Microsoft.HybridConnectivity**, **Microsoft.Kubernetes**, **Microsoft.ExtendedLocation**, and **Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration**.
  1. Create and verify a resource group for AKS Edge Essentials Azure resources.
- To connect to Arc, Kubernetes operators need a [**Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#kubernetes-cluster---azure-arc-onboarding) role for the identity at the resource group level. To disconnect from Arc, operators need an [**Azure Kubernetes Service Arc Contributor Role**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-arc-contributor-role) role for the identity at the resource group level. To check your access level, navigate to your subscription on the Azure portal, select **Access control (IAM)** on the left-hand side, and then select **View my access**. See [the Azure documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) for more information about managing resource groups. Infrastructure administrators with owner or contributor roles can also perform actions to connect or disconnect from Arc.
- In addition to these prerequisites, make sure you meet all [network requirements for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/network-requirements).

> [!NOTE]
> You need the **Contributor** role to be able to delete the resources within the resource group. Commands to disconnect from Arc will fail without this role assignment.

## Step 1: configure your machine

### Install dependencies

Run the following commands in an elevated PowerShell window to install the dependencies in PowerShell:

```powershell
Install-Module Az.Resources -Repository PSGallery -Force -AllowClobber -ErrorAction Stop  
Install-Module Az.Accounts -Repository PSGallery -Force -AllowClobber -ErrorAction Stop 
Install-Module Az.ConnectedKubernetes -Repository PSGallery -Force -AllowClobber -ErrorAction Stop  
```

## Step 2: configure your Azure environment

Provide details of your Azure subscription in the [**aksedge-config.json**](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/blob/main/tools/aksedge-config.json) file under the `Arc` section as described in the following table. To successfully connect to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled kubernetes, you need a service principal with the built-in `Microsoft.Kubernetes connected cluster role` in order to access resources on Azure. If you already have the service principal ID and password, you can update all the fields in the **aksedge-config.json** file. If you need to create a service principal, you can [follow the steps here](/azure/aks/hybrid/system-requirements?tabs=allow-table#optional-create-a-new-service-principal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Client secrets are a form of password. Proper management is critical to the security of your environment.
> - When you create the client secret, set a very short expiration time, based on the registration timing and scope for your deployment.
> - Be sure to protect the client secret value and the configuration file from general access.
> - Consider that if a cluster's configuration file is backed up while it has the client secret stored, the client secret is available to anyone with access to the backup.
> - Once you register a cluster, remove the client secret from the configuration file for that cluster.
> - Once you register all clusters in scope for your task, you should rotate the client secret and/or delete the service principal from your Microsoft Entra ID environment.

| Attribute | Value type      |  Description |
| :------------ |:-----------|:--------|
|`ClusterName` | string | The name of your cluster. The default value is `hostname_cluster`. |
|`Location` | string | The location of your resource group. Choose the location closest to your deployment. |
|`SubscriptionId` | GUID | Your subscription ID. In the Azure portal, select the subscription you're using and copy/paste the subscription ID string into the JSON. |
|`TenantId` | GUID | Your tenant ID. In the Azure portal, search **Microsoft Entra ID**, which should take you to the **Default Directory** page. From here, you can copy/paste the tenant ID string into the JSON. |
|`ResourceGroupName` | string | The name of the Azure resource group to host your Azure resources for AKS Edge Essentials. You can use an existing resource group, or if you add a new name, the system creates one for you. |
|`ClientId` | GUID | Provide the application ID of the Azure service principal to use as credentials. AKS Edge Essentials uses this service principal to connect your cluster to Arc. You can use the **App Registrations** page in the Microsoft Entra resource page on the Azure portal to list and manage the service principals in a tenant. Be aware that the service principal requires the **Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding** role at either the subscription or resource group level. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra identity requirements for service principals](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/system-requirements#microsoft-entra-identity-requirements). |
|`ClientSecret` | string | The password for the service principal. |

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to perform this configuration once per Azure subscription. You don't need to repeat the procedure for each Kubernetes cluster.

## Step 3: connect your cluster to Arc

Run `Connect-AksEdgeArc` to install and connect the existing cluster to Arc-enabled Kubernetes:

```powershell
# Connect Arc-enabled kubernetes
Connect-AksEdgeArc -JsonConfigFilePath .\aksedge-config.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> This step can take up to 10 minutes and PowerShell might become stuck on **Establishing Azure Connected Kubernetes for `your cluster name`**. PowerShell outputs `True` and returns to the prompt when the process is complete.

## Step 4: view AKS Edge Essentials resources in Azure

1. Once the process is complete, you can view your cluster in the Azure portal if you navigate to your resource group:

   :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/cluster-in-az-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the cluster in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/aks-edge/cluster-in-az-portal.png":::

2. On the left panel, select the **Namespaces** option, under **Kubernetes resources (preview)**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/kubernetes-resources-preview.png" alt-text="Kubernetes resources preview." lightbox="media/aks-edge/kubernetes-resources-preview.png":::

3. To view your Kubernetes resources, you need a bearer token.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/bearer-token-required.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the bearer token required page." lightbox="media/aks-edge/bearer-token-required.png":::

4. You can also run `Get-AksEdgeManagedServiceToken` to retrieve your service token.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/bearer-token-in-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to paste token in portal." lightbox="media/aks-edge/bearer-token-in-portal.png":::

5. Now you can view resources on your cluster. The **Workloads** option shows the pods running in your cluster.

   ```powershell
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/all-pods-in-arc.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing all pods in Arc." lightbox="media/aks-edge/all-pods-in-arc.png":::

## Disconnect from Arc

Run `Disconnect-AksEdgeArc` to disconnect from the Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

```powershell
# Disconnect Arc-enabled kubernetes
Disconnect-AksEdgeArc -JsonConfigFilePath .\aksedge-config.json
```
