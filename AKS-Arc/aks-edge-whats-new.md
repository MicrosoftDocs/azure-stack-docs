# What's new in AKS Edge Essentials

AKS Edge Essentials is a lightweight on-premises Kubernetes implementation of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that automates running containerized applications at scale. This article describes the latest features, enhancements, and updates in AKS Edge Essentials releases.

## Release 1.11.230.0 (September 2025)

The following features and improvements were added in this release:

- AKS Edge Essentials version 1.11.230.0 uses Azure Linux 3.0, an upgrade from Azure Linux 2.0, which was the version used in previous releases.
- AKS Edge Essentials now connects to Azure Arc during deployment to decrease the number of steps required. Arc parameters are required in the **aks-edge** configuration file during deployment. AKS Edge Essentials deployment is blocked if Arc parameters are missing or invalid. However, this does not impact offline deployments or volume licensing customers.

### Supported versions for 1.11.230.0

- AKS Edge Essentials version: 1.11.230.0
- Azure Linux (previously Mariner) Version: 3.0.20250822
- K8s (upstream Kubernetes) distribution: 1.30.5 (only available as an upgrade from 1.10.868.0), 1.31.5
- K3s distribution: 1.30.6 (only available as an upgrade from 1.10.868.0), 1.31.6
- Json version schema: 1.15

### Available upgrade paths

| Current version         | Upgrade path            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1.10.868.0 k8s/k3s 1.29 | 1.11.230.0 k8s/k3s 1.30 |
| 1.10.868.0 k8s/k3s 1.30 | 1.11.230.0 k8s/k3s 1.30 |
| 1.10.868.0 k8s/k3s 1.30 | 1.11.230.0 k8s/k3s 1.31 |

> [!NOTE]  
> Upgrading from one Kubernetes distribution to another within the same release version is not supported.

## Release 1.10.868.0 (March 2025)

The following features and improvements were added in this release:

- **Enable secret encryption on AKS Edge Essentials clusters with the Key Management Service (KMS) plugin (preview)**. Following Kubernetes best practices, it's recommended that you encrypt the Kubernetes secret store on clusters. You can enable the KMS plugin in the **aks-edge** config file during deployment. The KMS plugin is set to **disabled** by default during the preview period. For more information about this feature, see the [Key Management Service (KMS) plugin (preview)](aks-edge-howto-secret-encryption.md) documentation.
- **Key Manager for Kubernetes on AKS Edge Essentials (preview)**. [Key manager for Kubernetes](aks-edge-howto-key-manager.md) is an Azure Arc extension that automates the rotation of the signing key used to issue service account tokens. For more information about the Key Manager extension, see [Key manager for Kubernetes](aks-edge-howto-key-manager.md).
- **AKS Edge Essentials now connects to Azure Arc during deployment to decrease the number of required deployment steps.** Arc parameters are now required in the **aks-edge** configuration file during deployment. Starting with the next release, the AKS Edge Essentials deployment will be blocked if Arc parameters are missing or invalid.
- **The Calico CNI + K3s preview has been discontinued**. You must now use Flannel with K3s and Calico with K8s. For more information, see [Single machine deployment](aks-edge-howto-single-node-deployment.md#step-1-single-machine-configuration-parameters).
