# Security bulletins for AKS enabled by Azure Arc

This article provides information on security vulnerabilities that affect AKS enabled by Azure Arc and its components. This information includes details on:

- **Critical Security Advisories** — High-impact security vulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities and other critical CVEs that require immediate attention, along with mitigation guidance.
- **Ongoing Security Investigations** — Security issues under review, including CVEs where a patch isn't yet available or further assessment is needed.
- **False Positives & Non-Exploitable CVEs** — Cases where a reported CVE doesn't impact AKS enabled by Azure Arc due to specific configurations, mitigations, or lack of exploitability.

> [!NOTE]
> For security bulletins that affect AKS in Azure, see [Security bulletins for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/security-bulletins/overview).

## AKSARC-2026-0001: Advisory & Mitigation Guide for CVE-2026-31431 (Copy Fail)

**Last updated**: May 18, 2026

### Description

This bulletin provides an update on a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability that was publicly disclosed on April 29, 2026. The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel's `algif_aead` module. It has been assigned **CVE-2026-31431** and is referred to as **"Copy Fail"**.

- **CVSS Score**: 7.8 HIGH (`CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`)
- **Attack Vector**: Local — requires code execution on the node, for example, from a container
- **Affected Component**: `algif_aead` kernel module (hardware-accelerated cryptographic functions)
- **Canonical Advisory**: [https://ubuntu.com/blog/copy-fail-vulnerability-fixes-available](https://ubuntu.com/blog/copy-fail-vulnerability-fixes-available)

### References

- [CVE-2026-31431](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-31431)
- [AKS Advisory](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/5753)

### Affected Components

# [AKS on Azure Local](#tab/azure-local)

**Affected Versions**

- All current AKS on Azure Local Linux nodes are exploitable. We are working on integrating this fix into a future Azure Local update. In the meantime, follow the remediation steps below.
- Although `algif_aead` isn't loaded by default on AKS nodes, the Linux kernel's module auto-loading mechanism (`request_module`) **automatically loads it on demand**. Any process, **including unprivileged containers**, can trigger this mechanism by creating an AF_ALG socket with AEAD type. This condition means:
- **An attacker with code execution in any pod, even non-root, can escalate to root on the node.**
- No special pod privileges, capabilities, or host access are required.

**Resolutions**

Choose one of the following remediation paths.

#### Option A: Patch your Azure Local instance (recommended)

This option patches VHD images at the Azure Local level. After patching, upgrade each AKS cluster to refresh nodes with the patched VHDs.

##### Step 1: Upgrade Azure Local (if needed)

If your Azure Local deployment is on version 2601 or earlier, upgrade to 2602 or later before you continue. For upgrade guidance, see [Azure Local update documentation](/azure/azure-local/update/about-updates-23h2).

##### Step 2: Run the remediation command

1. Install the [AKS Arc Support Tool](/azure/aks/aksarc/support-module) and run `az login` on your Azure Local node.

2. Run the remediation command:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-SupportAksArcRemediation_FixCVE_2026_31431
   ```

   When complete, you see a confirmation message indicating that the update was applied or that no update is needed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After the command completes, wait 10-15 minutes for the new VHD images to download to your Azure Local deployment before proceeding to step 3.

##### Step 3: Upgrade AKS clusters

Upgrade each AKS cluster to refresh nodes with patched VHDs. Use the table below to determine your upgrade path.

| Current K8s version | Supported versions for Azure Local 2602 |
|---|---|
| 1.30 or earlier | 1.31.12, 1.31.13 |
| 1.31.12 | 1.31.13, 1.32.8, 1.32.9 |
| 1.31.13 | 1.32.8, 1.32.9 |
| 1.32.8 | 1.32.9, 1.33.4, 1.33.5 |
| 1.32.9 | 1.33.4, 1.33.5 |
| 1.33.4 | 1.33.5 |
| 1.33.5 (latest) | No upgrade available — use Option B |

To upgrade your cluster, follow the steps in [Upgrade the Kubernetes version](/azure/aks/aksarc/cluster-upgrade#upgrade-the-kubernetes-version). For the full version list, see [Supported Kubernetes versions](/azure/aks/aksarc/supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-arc-supported-kubernetes-minor-and-patch-versions-per-release).

After the upgrade completes, verify that all nodes are running the new image:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

#### Option B: Self-service mitigation (alternative)

If you can't upgrade Azure Local or your AKS clusters immediately, apply this per-cluster mitigation. This blocks the vulnerable kernel module from loading without requiring an Azure Local update or Kubernetes upgrade. Apply this to each existing cluster that needs protection. New clusters also require this mitigation until you complete Option A.

Apply the self-service mitigation described in the [AKS Advisory](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/5753). Once you upgrade your clusters and validate that the kernel includes the fix, you can remove the mitigation by following the cleanup steps in the same advisory.
