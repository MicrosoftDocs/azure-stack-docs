# Get kubelet logs from cluster nodes

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2](includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

As part of operating a Kubernetes cluster in AKS enabled by Azure Arc, you might need to review logs at some point to troubleshoot a problem. This article describes how to use `journalctl` to view the kubelet logs on a node.

## Create an SSH connection

First, you must create an SSH connection with the node on which you need to view the kubelet logs. To sign in using SSH, see [connect with SSH](ssh-connection.md) for Windows and Linux worker nodes.

## Get kubelet logs

Once you connect to the node, run the following command to pull the kubelet logs:

```console
chroot /host
journalctl -u kubelet -o cat
```

The following sample output shows the kubelet log data:

```output
I0512 19:15:19.651370    1824 server.go:411] Version: v1.19.7
I0512 19:15:19.651680    1824 server.go:831] Client rotation is on, will bootstrap in background

```

You can get the full on-demand logs from the cluster, then contact Microsoft for any required troubleshooting.
