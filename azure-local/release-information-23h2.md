To enhance your Azure Local experience, we periodically release feature updates that introduce new capabilities and improvements. Additionally, Azure Local provides cumulative updates that include monthly quality and security enhancements. These updates are listed for each instance, ensuring your devices remain protected and productive.

To keep your Azure Local solution in a supported state, you have up to six months to install updates, but we recommend installing updates as they're released.

This article provides the release information for Azure Local, version 23H2, including the release build and OS build information.  

## About Azure Local, version 23H2 releases

The Azure Local, version 23H2 includes multiple release trains: 2311, 2402, 2405, 2408, and 2411. Each release train includes a feature build and subsequent cumulative updates.

- **Feature build**: The feature update build is the initial version of the software in a release train. Feature releases go beyond quality and security fixes, incorporating product enhancements, including updates for Azure Local services and agents.

- **Cumulative build**: A cumulative update build includes the incremental updates from the most recent feature build.

- **Baseline release**: A version that is available to be installed directly as part of a fresh deployment. Starting with 2408.0, every release (both feature and cumulative builds) is a baseline release.

The following diagram illustrates the release trains, their associated feature builds, and update paths.

- Update the existing deployment to a build that allows you to move to the next release train. The following table provides examples of how to move between release trains:

  | Update scenario       | Timeframe           | Update path                                      |
  |-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | From 2402 to 2405     | May 2024            | 2402 --> 2402.3 --> 2405                         |
  | From 2402 to 2405.1   | June 2024  or later | 2402 --> 2402.4 --> 2405.1                       |

#### Move within the same release train

Follow these guidelines to move within the same release train:

- Within your release train, you can update to the latest update build anytime. For example, if you're running the 2405 feature build, you can update to any of the 2405 cumulative update builds, such as 2405.1, 2405.2, or 2405.3.

- To keep your Azure Local instance in a supported state, you have up to six months to install updates. For example, if you're running the 2405 feature build, update to a later build within six months.
