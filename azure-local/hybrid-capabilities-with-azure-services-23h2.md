# Hybrid capabilities with Azure services in Azure Local

This article outlines the hybrid capabilties available in Azure Local and describes the distinct ways Azure Arc enables these cababilities.

## Hybrid integration of Azure services with Azure Local

Azure Local allows you to take advantage of both cloud and on-premises resources working together. Through integration with Azure services, you can natively monitor, secure, and back up your local environment to Azure. [Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/overview) plays a cental role in this integration by extending the Azure control plane to your existing infrastructure. This integration allows you to run Azure-native workloads on Azure Local, and use Arc-enabled Azure services to manage both Azure Local infrastructure and VMs.

The following diagram shows how Azure Arc provides hybrid integration between Azure services and Azure Local and extends Azure control pane to your Azure Local environment:

## Hybrid capabilities in Azure Local

The hybrid capabilities in Azure Local help extend Azureâ€™s control plane to your on-premises infrastructure. These capabilities are enabled by the Azure Local cloud service and Azure Arc, allowing you to manage, monitor, secure, and update your local environment using familiar Azure tools, such as the [Azure portal](manage/azure-portal.md), [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.stackhci/?view=azps-7.2.0&preserve-view=true), and [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/stack-hci?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

The hybrid integration supports the following capabilities:

- **Registration.** To enable hybrid capabilities, you must register every Azure Local that you intend to connect with Azure Arc. For more information, see [Register your machines and assign permissions for Azure Local deployment](deploy/deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md).

- **Deployment and security.** Azure Local supports cloud-based deployment through the Azure portal or an Azure Resource Manager deployment template. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Local using the Azure portal](deploy/deploy-via-portal.md) and [Deploy Azure Local via the Azure Resource Manager deployment template](deploy/deployment-azure-resource-manager-template.md).

    The Azure Local deployment follows a secure-by-default strategy, including a tailored security baseline, a security drift control mechanism, and default security features. Post-deployment, you can view the security settings for Azure Local via the Azure portal. For more information, see [About security features](concepts/security-features.md).

- **Updates.** You can keep your Azure Local solution up-to-date with security fixes and feature improvements. The latest updates are identified and applied from the cloud through the Azure Update Manager tool. For more information, see [About updates for Azure Local](update/about-updates-23h2.md).

- **Monitoring.** You can perform basic monitoring of all Azure Local resources and confirm the deployment via the Azure portal. For more information, see [Verify a successful deployment](deploy/deploy-via-portal.md#verify-a-successful-deployment). Advanced monitoring utilizes Azure Monitor tools, such as Insights, Metrics, Logs, Workbooks, and Alerts. For information about monitoring Azure Local, see [What is Azure Local monitoring?](concepts/monitoring-overview.md).

- **Observability and support.** Azure Local observability feature collects telemetry and diagnostic data, which helps Microsoft in system analysis and issue resolution. Observability and remote support are integral to the Azure Local deployment process. For more information, see [Azure Local observability](concepts/observability.md) and [Get remote support for Azure Local](manage/get-remote-support.md).

- **Billing.** The Azure Local cloud service sends usage data to Azure Commerce to calculate the monthly bill for the registered subscription. You can pay for Azure Local through your Azure subscription. For more information, see [Azure Local billing and payment](concepts/billing.md).

- **Licensing.** An Azure Local requires cloud connectivity to keep its license up to date. The Azure Local cloud service validates proper registrations and distributes new licenses. To learn more about how licensing impacts functionality, see [Azure Local FAQ - What happens if the 30-day limit is exceeded?](faq.yml#what-happens-if-the-30-day-limit-is-exceeded)

   Azure verification for VMs makes it possible for supported Azure-exclusive workloads to work outside of the cloud. This feature is a built-in platform attestation service that is enabled by default on Azure Local. For more information, see [Azure verification for VMs](deploy/azure-verification.md?tabs=azureportal).

- **Diagnostics.** Azure Local diagnostic data helps Microsoft detect, diagnose, and fix problems to restore service health and improve products. To collect diagnostic data for a registered and connected system, see [Collect diagnostic logs for Azure Local](manage/collect-logs.md). To collect diagnostics data in scenarios where observability components aren't deployed or during issues with the system registration process, see [Perform standalone log collection](manage/get-support-for-deployment-issues.md#perform-standalone-log-collection).

- **Enhanced management.** You can perform enhanced management of your Azure Local from Azure. This feature is enabled by the Managed Identity created for your Azure Local resource that serves as the identity for the various components of your system. For more information, see [Enhanced management of Azure Local from Azure](manage/azure-enhanced-management-managed-identity.md).

## Workloads enabled by Azure Arc that run on Azure Local

Azure Arc enables you to deploy and run many Azure-native workloads directly within your Azure local environments.

See [Overview of Azure Local monitoring](./concepts/monitoring-overview.md).

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview).** Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects Azure Local from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. It helps improve the security posture of Azure Local, and can protect against existing and evolving threats. With the paid Defender for Servers plan, you get enhanced security features including security alerts for individual machines and Arc VMs. For more information, see [Manage system security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (preview)](./manage/manage-security-with-defender-for-cloud.md).

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoints <!--Couldn't find reference in docs.-->

- **Azure Policy.** Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. For more information, see [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview).

- **Azure Machine Configuration.** [Azure Machine configuration](/azure/governance/machine-configuration) (formerly Azure Policy Guest Configuration) is provided by the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). It's available at no cost and enables auditing and configuring OS settings as code for machines and VMs.
