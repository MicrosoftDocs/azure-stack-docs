::: moniker range="=azloc-2507"

## July OS security updates (KB5062570 and KB5062553) for Azure Local

For the 2507 release of Azure Local, Microsoft released two security updates, each corresponding to a specific OS build. The following table provides the details of these security updates, including their associated OS builds and release dates.

| Security update | OS build | Release date |
|--|--|--|
| KB5058384 | 25398.1732 | July 8, 2025 |
| KB5058411 | 26100.4652 | July 8, 2025 |

# [OS build 25398.xxxx](#tab/os-build-25398-xxxx)

This section provides the 2507 security updates associated with OS build **25398.1732**.

## Improvements

This security update includes quality improvements. Below is a summary of the key issues that this update addresses when you install this KB. If there are new features, it lists them as well. The bold text within the brackets indicates the item or area of the change.

- **[DNS Server]** Fixed: This update addresses an issue where a full zone transfer can't be completed from a Windows DNS server to another DNS server when Extension Mechanisms for DNS is enabled. 

- **[Language and character support]** Fixed: An issue that affected some Chinese characters and experienced compliance issues with GB18030. These characters didn't display correctly or weren't accepted when using extended Unicode. A modern ICU-based solution now properly supports GB18030-2022 requirements. 

- **[Performance]** Fixed: This update addresses an issue that prevented the complete removal of unused language packs and Feature on Demand packages, which previously led to unnecessary storage use and longer Windows Update installation times. 

- **[Security]** Fixed: This update upgrades the curl tool in Windows to version 8.13.0 to help protect against potential security risks, including unauthorized access to data or service disruptions.

- **[Microsoft RPC Netlogon protocol]** Fixed: This update includes a security hardening change to the Microsoft RPC Netlogon protocol. This change improves security by tightening access checks for a set of remote procedure call (RPC) requests. After this update is installed, Active Directory domain controllers will no longer allow anonymous clients to invoke some RPC requests through the Netlogon RPC server. These requests are typically related to domain controller location. Certain file and print service software can be affected, including Samba. If your organization uses Samba, please refer to the [Samba release notes](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.22.3.html).

## Known issues

### Noto fonts

**Symptoms**

There are reports of blurry or unclear CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text when displayed at 96 DPI (100% scaling) in Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. The March 2025 Preview Update introduced Noto fonts in collaboration with Google, for CJK languages as fallbacks to improve text rendering when websites or apps don’t specify appropriate fonts. The issue is due to limited pixel density at 96 DPI, which can reduce the clarity and alignment of CJK characters. Increasing the display scaling improves clarity by enhancing text rendering.

**Resolution**

As a temporary workaround, increase your display scaling to 125% or 150% to improve text clarity. For more information, see Change your screen resolution and layout in Windows.

We're investigating this issue and will provide more information when it's available.

## Known issues

The following is a known issue with this update.

**Symptom**

Devices that have certain Citrix components installed might be unable to complete installation of the January 2025 Windows security update. This issue was observed on devices with [Citrix Session Recording Agent (SRA)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/session-recording/current-release/install-upgrade-uninstall.html), version 2411. The 2411 version of this application was released in December 2024.
  
Affected devices might initially download and apply the January 2025 Windows security update correctly, such as via the Windows Update page in Settings. However, when restarting the device to complete the update installation, an error message with text similar to "*Something didn't go as planned. No need to worry – undoing changes*" appears. The device then reverts to the Windows updates previously present on the device.  
  
This issue likely affects a limited number of organizations as version 2411 of the SRA application is a new version. Home users aren't expected to be affected by this issue.

**Workaround**

## February OS security update (KB5051980) for Azure Local

This article describes the OS security update for Azure Local that was released on February 11, 2025 and applies to OS build 25398.1425.

## Improvements 

This security update includes quality improvements. Below is a summary of the key issues that this update addresses when you install this KB. If there are new features, it lists them as well. The bold text within the brackets indicates the item or area of the change.

- **[Cluster stability]** Fixed: Many machines within the same system suddenly shut down. The network is less available, and latency rises.  

- **[Task Manager]** Fixed: The CPU index number might be wrong when you set process affinity. This occurs on servers that have two or more non-uniform memory access (NUMA) nodes.  

- **[GB18030-2022]** This update adds support for this amendment.  

- **[Memory leak]** Fixed: Leaks occur when predictive input ideas show.  

- **[Windows Kernel Vulnerable Driver Blocklist file (DriverSiPolicy.p7b)]** This update adds to the list of drivers that are at risk for Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks.  

- **[Virtual machine (VM) storage pool]** Fixed: Some operations that rely on a storage pool stop working. This occurs because the virtual machine (VM)can't reclaim disk space to do task such as load balancing.

- **[USB cameras]** Fixed: Your device does not recognize the camera is on. This issue occurs after you install the January 2025 security update.

- **Digital/Analog converter (DAC)** Fixed: You might experience issues with USB audio devices. This is more likely when you use a DAC audio driver based on [USB 1.0](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/usb-audio-class-system-driver--usbaudio-sys-). USB audio devices might stop working, which stops playback.

## Known issues

The following is a known issue with this update.

**Symptom**

Following the installation of the October 2024 security update, some customers report that the OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) service fails to start, preventing SSH connections. The service fails with no detailed logging, and manual intervention is required to run the sshd.exe process.

This issue is affecting enterprise, IOT, and education customers, with a limited number of devices impacted. Microsoft is investigating whether consumer customers using Home or Pro editions of Windows are also affected.

**Workaround**

You can temporarily resolve this issue by updating permissions (ACLs) on the affected directories. Follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.

1. Update the permissions for *C:\ProgramData\ssh* and *C:\ProgramData\ssh\logs* to allow full control for **System** and the **Administrators** group, while allowing read access for **Authenticated Users**. You can restrict read access to specific users or groups by modifying the permissions string if needed.

1. Use the following commands to update the permissions:

    ```azurecli
    $directoryPath = "C:\ProgramData\ssh" $acl = Get-Acl -Path $directoryPath $sddlString = "O:BAD:PAI(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;BA)(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;AU)" $securityDescriptor = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor $sddlString $acl.SetSecurityDescriptorSddlForm($securityDescriptor.GetSddlForm("All")) Set-Acl -Path $directoryPath -AclObject $acl
    ```

1. Repeat the above steps for *C:\ProgramData\ssh\logs*.

Microsoft is actively investigating the issue and will provide a resolution in an upcoming Windows update. Further communications will be provided when a resolution or addition is available.

- **Autopilot**. Using Autopilot to provision a Surface Laptop SE device fails.  

- **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)**. A memory leak occurs that might exhaust system memory as time goes by. This issue occurs when you provision a device.  

- **Protected Process Light (PPL) protections**. You can bypass them.  

- **Windows Kernel Vulnerable Driver Blocklist file (DriverSiPolicy.p7b)**. This update adds to the list of drivers that are at risk for Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks.  

- **NetJoinLegacyAccountReuse**. This update removes this registry key. For more information, see [KB 5020276 Net join: Domain join hardening changes](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5020276-netjoin-domain-join-hardening-changes-2b65a0f3-1f4c-42ef-ac0f-1caaf421baf8).

- **BitLocker (known issue)**. A [BitLocker recovery screen](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/recovery-overview) shows when you start up your device. This occurs after you install the July 9, 2024, update. This issue is more likely to occur if [device encryption](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838) is on. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Device encryption**. To unlock your drive, Windows might ask you to enter the recovery key from your Microsoft account.

- **Lock screen**. This update addresses CVE-2024-38143. As a result, the **Use my windows user account** check box isn't available on the lock screen to connect to Wi-Fi.

- **Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) and Linux Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)**. This update applies SBAT to systems that run Windows and stops vulnerable Linux EFI (shim bootloaders) from running. This update doesn't apply to systems that dual-boot Windows and Linux. After the update is applied, older Linux ISO images might not boot. If this occurs, work with your Linux vendor to get an updated ISO image.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**. This update hardens DNS server security to address CVE-2024-37968. If the configurations of your domains aren't up to date, you might get the SERVFAIL error or a time-out.

- **Absent apps and features**. Some apps and features are absent after you upgrade to Windows 11.

- **[BCryptSignHash](/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptsignhash) API known issue**. Because of this issue, the API returns `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`. This occurs when callers use NULL padding input parameters for RSA signatures. This issue is more likely to occur when Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) are in use, like on an Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pool.

- **Input Method Editor (IME)**. The candidate list fails to show or shows it in the wrong position.

- **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**. A malformed Human Interface Device (HID) descriptor causes WPF to stop responding.

- **Handwriting panels and touch keyboards**. They don't appear when you use the tablet pen.

- ***HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM ForceDisableModeChangeAnimation (REG_DWORD)***. This is a new registry key. When you set its value to `1` (or a non-zero number), it turns off the display mode change animation. If the value is `0` or the key doesn't exist, the animation is set to on.

- **Remote Desktop MultiPoint Server**. A race condition causes the service to stop responding.
