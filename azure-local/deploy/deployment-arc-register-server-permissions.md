# Register your machines and assign permissions for Azure Local deployment

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes how to register your Azure Local machines and then set up the required permissions to deploy Azure Local.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you've completed the following prerequisites:

- Satisfy the [prerequisites and complete deployment checklist](./deployment-prerequisites.md).
- Prepare your [Active Directory](./deployment-prep-active-directory.md) environment.
- [Install the Azure Stack HCI operating system, version 23H2](./deployment-install-os.md) on each machine.

- Register your subscription with the required resource providers (RPs). You can use either the [Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1) or the [Azure PowerShell](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-powershell) to register. You need to be an owner or contributor on your subscription to register the following resource RPs:

    - *Microsoft.HybridCompute*
    - *Microsoft.GuestConfiguration*
    - *Microsoft.HybridConnectivity*
    - *Microsoft.AzureStackHCI*

    > [!NOTE]
    > The assumption is that the person registering the Azure subscription with the resource providers is a different person than the one who is registering the Azure Local machines with Arc.

- If you're registering the machines as Arc resources, make sure that you have the following permissions on the resource group where the machines were provisioned:

    - Azure Connected Machine Onboarding
    - Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator

    To verify that you have these roles, follow these steps in the Azure portal:

    1. Go to the subscription that you use for the Azure Local deployment.
    1. Go to the resource group where you're planning to register the machines.
    1. In the left-pane, go to **Access Control (IAM)**.
    1. In the right-pane, go the **Role assignments**. Verify that you have the **Azure Connected Machine Onboarding** and **Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator** roles assigned.

- Check your Azure policies. Make sure that:
    - The Azure policies aren't blocking the installation of extensions.
    - The Azure policies aren't blocking the creation of certain resource types in a resource group.
    - The Azure policies aren't blocking the resource deployment in certain locations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Express Route and Azure Private Link are not supported for Azure Local or any of its components as it is not possible to access the public endpoints required for Azure Local.

## Register machines with Azure Arc

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run these steps as a local administrator on every Azure Local machine that you intend to cluster.


1. Set the parameters. The script takes in the following parameters:

    |Parameters  |Description  |
    |------------|-------------|
    |`SubscriptionID`    |The ID of the subscription used to register your machines with Azure Arc.         |
    |`TenantID`          |The tenant ID used to register your machines with Azure Arc. Go to your Microsoft Entra ID and copy the tenant ID property.       |
    |`ResourceGroup`     |The resource group precreated for Arc registration of the machines. A resource group is created if one doesn't exist.         |
    |`Region`            |The Azure region used for registration. See the [Supported regions](../concepts/system-requirements-23h2.md#azure-requirements) that can be used.          |
    |`AccountID`         |The user who registers and deploys the instance.         |
    |`ProxyServer`       |Optional parameter. Proxy Server address when is required for outbound connectivity. |
    |`DeviceCode`        |The device code displayed in the console at `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` and is used to sign in to the device.         |

    
    # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

    ```powershell
    #Define the subscription where you want to register your machine as Arc device
    $Subscription = "YourSubscriptionID"
    
    #Define the resource group where you want to register your machine as Arc device
    $RG = "YourResourceGroupName"

    #Define the region to use to register your server as Arc device
    #Do not use spaces or capital letters when defining region
    $Region = "eastus"
    
    #Define the tenant you will use to register your machine as Arc device
    $Tenant = "YourTenantID"
    
    #Define the proxy address if your Azure Local deployment accesses the internet via proxy
    $ProxyServer = "http://proxyaddress:port"
    ```
 
    # [Output](#tab/output)

    Here's a sample output of the parameters:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Subscription = "<Subscription ID>"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $RG = "myashcirg"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Tenant = "<Tenant ID>"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Region = "eastus"
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $ProxyServer = "<http://proxyserver:tcpPort>"
    ```

    ---
2. Connect to your Azure account and set the subscription. You'll need to open browser on the client that you're using to connect to the machine and open this page: `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` and enter the provided code in the Azure CLI output to authenticate. Get the access token and account ID for the registration.  

    # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

    ```azurecli
    #Connect to your Azure account and Subscription
    Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId $Subscription -TenantId $Tenant -DeviceCode

    #Get the Access Token for the registration
    $ARMtoken = (Get-AzAccessToken -WarningAction SilentlyContinue).Token

    #Get the Account ID for the registration
    $id = (Get-AzContext).Account.Id   
    ```

    # [Output](#tab/output)

    Here's a sample output of setting the subscription and authentication:

    ```output
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId $Subscription -TenantId $Tenant -DeviceCode
    WARNING: To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code A44KHK5B5
    to authenticate.
    
    Account               SubscriptionName      TenantId                Environment
    -------               ----------------      --------                ----------- 
    guspinto@contoso.com AzureStackHCI_Content  <Tenant ID>             AzureCloud

    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $ARMtoken = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
    PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $id = (Get-AzContext).Account.Id
    ```

    ---

3. Finally run the Arc registration script. The script takes a few minutes to run.

    # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

    ```powershell
    #Invoke the registration script. Use a supported region.
    Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -TenantID $Tenant -Region $Region -Cloud "AzureCloud" -ArmAccessToken $ARMtoken -AccountID $id -Proxy $ProxyServer
    ```

    If you're accessing the internet via a proxy server, you need to pass the `-proxy` parameter and provide the proxy server as `http://<Proxy server FQDN or IP address>:Port` when running the script.

    For a list of supported Azure regions, see [Azure requirements](../concepts/system-requirements-23h2.md#azure-requirements).

    # [Output](#tab/output)

    Here's a sample output of a successful registration of your machines:
    
    ```output
    PS C:\Users\Administrator> Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -TenantID $Tenant -Region $Region -Cloud "AzureCloud" -ArmAccessToken $ARMtoken -AccountID $id

4. After the script completes successfully on all the machines, verify that:


    1. Your machines are registered with Arc. Go to the Azure portal and then go to the resource group associated with the registration. The machines appear within the specified resource group as **Machine - Azure Arc** type resources.
