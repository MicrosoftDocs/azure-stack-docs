# Register Azure Local with Azure Arc

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2506"

::: zone pivot="register-proxy"

This article details how to register Azure Local machines with Azure Arc and with proxy configuration. The proxy configuration can be done via an Arc script or via the Configurator app for Azure Local.

- **Configure with a script**: You can use an Arc script to configure registration settings.

- **Set up via the Configurator app (Preview)**: Using this method, you can configure Azure Local registration via a user interface. This method is useful if you prefer not to use scripts or if you want to configure the settings interactively.

# [Via Arc script](#tab/script)

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

- You have access to Azure Local machines running release 2506 or later. 
- You have assigned the appropriate permissions to the subscription used for registration. For more information, see [Assign required permissions for Azure Local deployment](deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run these steps as a local administrator on every Azure Local machine that you intend to cluster.

## Step 1: Review script parameters

Review the parameters used in the script:

|Parameters  |Description  |
|------------|-------------|
|`TenantID`          |The tenant ID used to register your machines with Azure Arc. Go to your Microsoft Entra ID and copy the tenant ID property.         |
|`SubscriptionID`    |The ID of the subscription used to register your machines with Azure Arc.         |
|`ResourceGroup`     |The resource group precreated for Arc registration of the machines. A resource group is created if one doesn't exist.         |
|`Region`            |The Azure region used for registration. See the [Supported regions](../concepts/system-requirements-23h2.md#azure-requirements) that can be used.          |
|`ProxyServer`       |Optional parameter. Proxy Server address when required for outbound connectivity. |



## Step 2: Set parameters

Set the parameters required for the registration script.

Here's an example of how you should change these parameters for the `Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization` initialization script. Once the registration is complete, the Azure Local machines are registered in Azure Arc:

```powershell
#Define the tenant you will use to register your machine as Arc device
$Tenant = "YourTenantID"

#Define the subscription where you want to register your Azure Local machine with Arc.
$Subscription = "YourSubscriptionID"

#Define the resource group where you want to register your Azure Local machine with Arc.
$RG = "YourResourceGroupName"

#Define the region to use to register your server as Arc device
#Do not use spaces or capital letters when defining region
$Region = "eastus"

#Define the proxy address for your Azure Local deployment to access the internet via proxy.
$ProxyServer = "http://proxyaddress:port"

#Define the bypass list for the proxy. Use comma to separate each item from the list.  
# Parameters must be separated with a comma `,`.
# Use "localhost" instead of <local> 
# Use specific IPs such as 127.0.0.1 without mask 
# Use * for subnets allowlisting. 192.168.1.* for /24 exclusions. Use 192.168.*.* for /16 exclusions. 
# Append * for domain names exclusions like *.contoso.com 
# DO NOT INCLUDE .svc on the list. The registration script takes care of Environment Variables configuration. 
# At least the IP address of each Azure Local machine.
# At least the IP address of the Azure Local cluster.
# At least the IPs you defined for your infrastructure network. Arc resource bridge, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and future infrastructure services using these IPs require outbound connectivity.
# NetBIOS name of each machine.
# NetBIOS name of the Azure Local cluster.

$ProxyBypassList = "localhost,127.0.0.1,*.contoso.com,machine1,machine2,machine3,machine4,machine5,192.168.*.*,AzureLocal-1"
```

<summary>Expand this section to see an example output.</summary>

```output
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Subscription = "Subscription ID"
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $RG = "myashcirg"
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Region = "eastus"
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $Tenant = "Tenant ID"
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $ProxyServer = "http://192.168.10.10:8080"
PS C:\Users\SetupUser> $ProxyBypassList = "localhost,127.0.0.1,*.contoso.com,machine1,machine2,machine3,machine4,machine5,192.168.*.*,AzureLocal-1"
```

</details>



## Step 3: Run registration script


1. Run the Arc registration script. The script takes a few minutes to run.

    ```powershell
    #Invoke the registration script. Use a supported region.
    Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -TenantId $Tenant -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -Region $Region -Cloud "AzureCloud" -Proxy $ProxyServer -ProxyBypass $ProxyBypassList 
    ```

    For a list of supported Azure regions, see [Azure requirements](../concepts/system-requirements-23h2.md#azure-requirements).

This article details how to register using Azure Arc gateway on Azure Local without the proxy configuration. You can register via the Arc script or the Configurator app.

- **Configure with a script**: Using this method, configure the registration settings via a script.

- **Set up via the Configurator app**: Configure Azure Arc gateway via a user interface. This method is useful if you prefer not to use scripts or if you want to configure the registration settings interactively.

# [Via Arc script](#tab/script)

## Prerequisites for registration without proxy configuration

Make sure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

- You have access to Azure Local machines running release 2503 or 2504.
- You have assigned the appropriate permissions to the subscription used for registration. For more information, see [Assign required permissions for Azure Local deployment](deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run these steps as a local administrator on every Azure Local machine that you intend to cluster.

## Review script parameters


Review the parameters used in the script:

|Parameters  |Description  |
