# Register Azure Local with Azure Arc using Arc gateway (Preview)

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2505"

::: zone pivot="register-proxy"

This article details how to register Azure Local using Azure Arc gateway and with the proxy configuration enabled. Once you create an Arc gateway resource in your Azure subscription, you can enable the Arc gateway features.

- **Configure proxy with a script**: Using this method, you can configure Arc proxy with a script. This method is useful as you don't need to configure the Arc proxy across WinInet, WinHttp, or environment variables manually.

- **Set up proxy via the Configurator app**: Using this method, you can configure the Arc proxy via a user interface. This method is useful if you prefer not to use scripts or if you want to configure the proxy settings interactively.

[!INCLUDE [hci-preview](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

# [Via Arc script](#tab/script)

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following prerequisites are met before you proceed:

- You have access to Azure Local machines running release 2505 or later. Prior versions don't support this scenario.

- You have assigned the appropriate permissions to the subscription used for registration. For more information, see [Assign required permissions for Azure Local deployment](deployment-arc-register-server-permissions.md).

- An Arc gateway resource created in the same subscription as used to deploy Azure Local. For more information, see [Create the Arc gateway resource in Azure](deployment-azure-arc-gateway-overview.md#create-the-arc-gateway-resource-in-azure).

## Step 1: Get the Arc gateway ID  

- **Get Arc gateway ID**. To create Azure Arc gateway, see [Set up an Azure Arc gateway](../deploy/deployment-azure-arc-gateway-overview.md#create-the-arc-gateway-resource-in-azure) and get the resource ID of the Arc gateway. This is also referred to as the `ArcGatewayID`.

   1. In the Azure portal, go to the Arc gateway resource that you created.
   1. On the **Overview** page, copy the **Resource ID**. You use this Arc gateway ID later.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-gateway-resource-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Resource ID in the Overview page for Azure Arc gateway." lightbox="media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-gateway-resource-id.png":::

## Step 2: Set parameters

1. Set the parameters required for the registration script.

    Here's an example of how you should change these parameters for the `Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization` initialization script. 

    ```powershell
    #Define the subscription where you want to register your Azure Local machine with Arc.
    $Subscription = "yourSubscriptionID" 
    
    #Define the resource group where you want to register your Azure Local machine with Arc.
    $RG = "yourResourceGroupName" 
    
    #Define the region to use to register your server as Arc device
    #Do not use spaces or capital letters when defining region
    $Region = "eastus"
    
    #Define the proxy address for your Azure Local deployment to access the internet via proxy.
    $ProxyServer = "http://proxyaddress:port"    
   
    #Define the bypass list for the proxy. Use comma to separate each item from the list.  
    # Parameters must be separated with a comma `,`.
    # Use "localhost" instead of <local> 
    # Use specific IPs such as 127.0.0.1 without mask 
    # Use * for subnets allowlisting. 192.168.1.* for /24 exclusions. Use 192.168.*.* for /16 exclusions. 
    # Append * for domain names exclusions like *.contoso.com 
    # DO NOT INCLUDE .svc on the list. The registration script takes care of Environment Variables configuration. 
    # At least the IP address of each Azure Local machine.
    # At least the IP address of the Azure Local cluster.
    # At least the IPs you defined for your infrastructure network. Arc resource bridge, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and future infrastructure services using these IPs require outbound connectivity.
    # NetBIOS name of each machine.
    # NetBIOS name of the Azure Local cluster.
    
    $ProxyBypassList = "localhost,127.0.0.1,*.contoso.com,machine1,machine2,machine3,machine4,machine5,192.168.*.*,AzureLocal-1" 

    #Define the Arc gateway resource ID from Azure 
    $ArcgwId = "/subscriptions/yourarcgatewayid/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/gateways/yourArcGatewayName" 
    ```

## Step 3: Run registration script


1. Run the Arc registration script. The script takes a few minutes to run.

    ```Powershell
    #Invoke the registration script with Proxy and ArcgatewayID 
    Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -Region australiaeast -Cloud "AzureCloud" -Proxy $ProxyServer -ArcGatewayID $ArcgwId -ProxyBypass $ProxyBypassList 
    ```

1. During the Arc registration process, you must authenticate with your Azure account. The console window displays a code that you must enter in the URL, displayed in the app, in order to authenticate. Follow the instructions to complete the authentication process.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/authentication-device-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console window with the device code and the URL to open." lightbox="media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/authentication-device-code.png":::

## Step 4: Verify the Azure Arc gateway setup is successful

Once the registration is complete, follow these steps to verify that Azure Arc gateway setup is successful.

1. connect to the first Azure Local machine from your system.

1. Open the Arc gateway log to monitor which endpoints are being redirected to the Arc gateway and which ones continue using your firewall or proxy. You can find the Arc gateway log at: *c:\programdata\AzureConnectedMAchineAgent\Log\arcproxy.log*.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-gateway-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Arc gateway log using script." lightbox="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-gateway-log.png":::

2. To check the Arc agent configuration and verify that it's using the gateway, run the following command:

   ```
   C:\program files\AzureConnectedMachineAgent>.\azcmagent show
   ```

   The values displayed should be as follows:
    
   1. **Agent version** is **1.45** or later.
    
   2. **Agent Status** should show as **Connected**.
    
   3. **Using HTTPS Proxy**  shows as `http://localhost:40343`when the Arc gateway is enabled.
    
   4. **Upstream Proxy** shows your enterprise proxy server and port.
    
   5. **Azure Arc Proxy** shows as **running** when the Arc gateway is enabled.
    
      
   :::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-agent-with-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Arc agent with gateway using script." lightbox="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-agent-with-gateway.png":::
    
3. Additionally, to verify that the setup was done successfully, run the following command:

   ```
   C:\program files\AzureConnectedMachineAgent>.\azcmagent check
   ```
    
   The response should indicate that the **connection.type** is set to **gateway**, and the **Reachable** column should indicate **true** for all URLs.

   
   Here's an example of the Arc agent using the Arc gateway:
    
   :::image type="content" source="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-agent-with-gateway-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Arc agent with Arc gateway using script." lightbox="./media/deployment-with-azure-arc-gateway/arc-agent-with-gateway-2.png":::
    
   You can also audit your gateway traffic by viewing the gateway router logs.  
    
   To view gateway router logs on Windows, run the `azcmagent logs` command in PowerShell. In the resulting .zip file, the logs are located in the *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ArcGatewayRouter* folder.
