# Use Azure Arc gateway without a proxy on Azure Local (preview)

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2505"

> Applies to: Azure Local 2505 and later

After creating the Arc gateway resource in your Azure subscription, you can enable the new Arc gateway preview features on your Azure Local. This article details how to use Azure gateway for Azure Local instances without a proxy.

[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

- You've access to an Azure Local instance running release 2411.1 or later. Prior versions do not support this scenario.

- An Arc gateway resource created in the same subscription as used to deploy Azure Local. For more information, see [Create the Arc gateway resource in Azure](deployment-azure-arc-gateway-overview.md#create-the-arc-gateway-resource-in-azure).

## Step 1: Get the ArcGatewayID  

You need the Arc gateway ID (ArcGatewayID) from Azure to run the registration script on Azure Local machines. You can find the Arc gateway ID on the Azure portal overview page of the resource.

## Step 2: Register new machines in Azure Arc

To use the Arc gateway feature for Azure Local systems without a proxy, only use the `ArcGatewayID` parameter.

Run the initialization script as follows.

```azurecli

#Define the subscription where you want to register your server as Arc device.
$Subscription = "yoursubscription"

#Define the resource group where you want to register your server as Arc device.
$RG = "yourresourcegroupname"

#Define the Arc gateway resource ID from Azure
$ArcgwId = "/subscriptions/yourarcgatewayid/resourceGroups/yourresourcegroupname/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/gateways/yourarcgatewayname"

#Invoke the registration script with Proxy and ArcgatewayID
Invoke-AzStackHciArcInitialization -SubscriptionID $Subscription -ResourceGroup $RG -Region australiaeast -Cloud "AzureCloud" -ArcGatewayID $ArcgwId
```

## Step 3: Start Azure Local cloud deployment

Once the Azure Local machines are registered in Azure Arc and all the extensions are installed, you can start deployment from Azure portal or using the ARM templates that are documented in these articles:

- [Deploy an Azure Local instance using the Azure portal](deploy-via-portal.md).

- [Azure Resource Manager template deployment for Azure Local](deployment-azure-resource-manager-template.md).

## Step 4: Verify that the setup succeeded

Once the deployment validation starts, you can connect to the first Azure Local machine from your system and open the Arc gateway log to monitor which endpoints are redirected to the Arc gateway and which ones continue using your firewall.

You can find the Arc gateway log at: *c:\programdata\AzureConnectedMAchineAgent\Log\arcproxy.log*.

To check the Arc agent configuration and verify that it is using the Arc gateway, run the following command: `c:\program files\AzureConnectedMachineAgent>.\azcmagent show`

The result should show the following values:

- **Agent version** is **1.45** or above.

- **Agent Status** is **Connected**.

- **Using HTTPS Proxy**  is empty when Arc gateway isn't in use. It should show as `http://localhost:40343` when the Arc gateway is enabled.

- **Upstream Proxy** should be empty because you are not using any enterprise proxy.

- **Azure Arc Proxy** shows as **stopped** when Arc gateway isn't in use, and **running** when the Arc gateway is enabled.

The Arc agent without the Arc gateway:

Additionally, to verify that the setup successful, you can run the following command: `c:\program files\AzureConnectedMachineAgent>.\azcmagent check`.

The response should indicate that `connection.type` is set to `gateway`, and the **Reachable** column should indicate **true** for all URLs, as shown:

The Arc agent with the Arc gateway enabled:

You can also audit your gateway traffic by viewing the gateway router logs.  

To view gateway router logs on Windows, run the `azcmagent logs` command in PowerShell. In the resulting .zip file, the logs are located in the *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ArcGatewayRouter* folder.
