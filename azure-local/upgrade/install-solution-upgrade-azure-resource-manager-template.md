# Install solution upgrade on Azure Local using Azure Resource Manager template

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [end-of-service-22H2](../includes/end-of-service-22h2.md)]

This article describes how to install the solution upgrade on your Azure Local instance using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, after upgrading the operating system (OS) build from 20349.xxxx (22H2) to 25398.xxxx (23H2).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - While the OS upgrade is generally available, the solution upgrade is rolled out in phases. Additionally, the solution upgrade isn't available to customers in Azure China.
> - Installing solution upgrade using ARM template is targeted for at-scale upgrades. This method is intended for IT administrators who have experience managing Azure Local instances. We recommend that you upgrade a system via the Azure portal first, and then use ARM template for subsequent upgrades. To install the solution upgrade via the Azure portal, see [Install solution upgrade on Azure Local](./install-solution-upgrade.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you install the solution upgrade, make sure that you:

- Validate the system using the Environment Checker as per the instructions in [Assess solution upgrade readiness](./validate-solution-upgrade-readiness.md#run-the-validation).
- Have failover cluster name between 3 to 15 characters.
- Create an Active Directory Lifecycle Manager (LCM) user account that's a member of the local Administrator group. For instructions, see [Prepare Active Directory for Azure Local deployment](../deploy/deployment-prep-active-directory.md).
- Have IPv4 network range that matches your host IP address subnet with six, contiguous IP addresses available for new Azure Arc services. Work with your network administrator to ensure that the IP addresses aren't in use and meet the outbound connectivity requirement.
- Have Azure subscription permissions for [Azure Stack HCI Administrator and Reader](../manage/assign-vm-rbac-roles.md#about-built-in-rbac-roles).

::: moniker range="<=azloc-24113"

- For Azure Local 2411.3 and earlier versions, make sure to select the **upgrade-cluster-2411.3** template for upgrade.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2503"

- For Azure Local 2503 and later versions, make sure to select the **upgrade-cluster** template for upgrade.

::: moniker-end

## Before you begin

There are a few things to consider before you begin the solution upgrade process:

- Microsoft supports upgrade applied from Azure Local resource page or by using an ARM template. Use of third-party tools to install upgrades isn't supported.
- We recommend you perform the solution upgrade during a maintenance window. After the upgrade, host machine might reboot and the workloads will be live migrated, causing brief disconnections.
<!--Confirm if this point is valid for ARM upgrade- If you have Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads on Azure Local, wait for the solution upgrade banner to appear on the Azure Local resource page. Then, remove AKS and all AKS hybrid settings before you apply the solution upgrade.-->
- By installing the solution upgrade, existing unmanaged VMs won't automatically become Azure Arc VMs. For more information about VMs on Azure Local, see [Types of VMs on Azure Local](../concepts/compare-vm-management-capabilities.md#types-of-vms-on-azure-local).

## Step 1: Prepare Azure resources

Follow these steps to prepare the Azure resources you need for the upgrade:

::: moniker range="<=azloc-24113"

### Create a service principal and client secret

To authenticate your system, you need to create a service principal and a corresponding **Client secret** for Arc Resource Bridge (ARB).

### Create a service principal for ARB

Follow the steps in [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources via Azure portal](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create the service principal and assign the roles. Alternatively, use the PowerShell procedure to [Create an Azure service principal with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps).

The steps are also summarized here:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a Cloud Application Administrator. Browse to **Identity > Applications > App registrations** then select **New registration**.

1. Provide a **Name** for the application, select a **Supported account type**, and then select **Register**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-register.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Register an application for service principal creation." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-register.png":::

1. Once the service principal is created, go to the **Enterprise applications** page. Search for and select the SPN you created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing search results for the service principal created." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-search.png":::

1. Under properties, copy the **Application (client) ID**  and the **Object ID** for this service principal.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Application (client) ID and the object ID for the service principal created." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-service-principal-id.png":::

    You use the **Application (client) ID** against the `arbDeploymentAppID` parameter and the **Object ID** against the `arbDeploymentSPNObjectID` parameter in the Resource Manager template.

### Create a client secret for ARB service principal

1. Go to the application registration that you created and browse to **Certificates & secrets > Client secrets**.
1. Select **+ New client** secret.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing creation of a new client secret." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-new.png":::

1. Add a **Description** for the client secret and provide a timeframe when it **Expires**. Select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Add a client secret blade." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-add.png":::

1. Copy the **client secret value** as you use it later.

    > [!Note]
    > For the application client ID, you will need it's secret value. Client secret values can't be viewed except for immediately after creation. Be sure to save this value when created before leaving the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing client secret value." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/create-client-secret-value.png":::

    You use the **client secret value** against the `arbDeploymentAppSecret` parameter in the Resource Manager template.

::: moniker-end

### Get the object ID for Azure Local Resource Provider

This object ID for the Azure Local Resource Provide (RP) is unique per Azure tenant.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and go to Microsoft Entra ID.  
1. Go to the **Overview** tab and search for *Microsoft.AzureStackHCI Resource Provider*.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/search-resource-provider-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the search for the Azure Local Resource Provider service principal." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/search-resource-provider-overview.png":::

1. Select the Service Principal Name that is listed and copy the **Object ID**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/get-object-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the object ID for the Azure Local Resource Provider service principal." lightbox="./media/install-solution-upgrade-azure-resource-manager-template/get-object-id.png":::

    Alternatively, you can use PowerShell to get the object ID of the Azure Local RP service principal. Run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "Microsoft.AzureStackHCI Resource Provider"
    ```

## Install the solution upgrade using Azure Resource Manager template

An ARM template creates and assigns all the resource permissions required for the upgrade.
With all the prerequisite and preparation steps complete, you're ready to upgrade using a known good and tested ARM template and corresponding parameters JSON file. Use the parameters contained in the JSON file to fill out all values, including the values generated previously.
For an example of a parameter JSON file, see [azuredeploy.parameters.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.azurestackhci/upgrade-cluster/azuredeploy.parameters.json). For detailed descriptions of the parameters defined in this file, see [ARM template parameters reference](#arm-template-parameters-reference).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all parameters in the JSON file are filled out, including placeholders that appear as `[“”]`, which indicate that the parameter expects an array structure. Replace these with actual values based on your deployment environment, or validation will fail.

Follow these steps to install the solution upgrade:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Home** and select **+ Create a resource**.

2. Select **Create** under **Template deployment (deploy using custom templates)**.
