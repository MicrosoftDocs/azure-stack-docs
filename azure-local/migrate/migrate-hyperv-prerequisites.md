# Prerequisites for Hyper-V VM migration to Azure Local using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes the prerequisite tasks you need to complete before you begin the process to migrate Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) to Azure Local. Make sure to [review the requirements](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md) for migration if you haven't already.

[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

The following list contains the prerequisites that must be met to migrate Hyper-V VMs to Azure Local. Some prerequisites apply to the source Hyper-V server, some to the target Azure Local instance, and others to both.

|Prerequisite|Applies to|More information|
|--|--|--|
|Open required firewall ports.|source, target|**3389** – Inbound connections on port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance. <br> **44368** – Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app by using the URL: *https:\//\<appliance-ip-or-name\>:44368*. <br> **5985, 5986** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 5985 (WinRM) to communicate from appliance to host. <br> **445** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 445 (SMB) to communicate between source and target appliance.|

## Create an Azure Migrate project

Before you can migrate, create an Azure Migrate project in Azure portal using the following procedure. For more information, see [Create and manage projects](/azure/migrate/create-manage-projects).

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Migrate**.

1. On the **Get started** page, under **Servers, databases and web apps**, select **Discover, assess and migrate**.

1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, select **Create project**.

1. On the **Create project** page:
    1. Enter your subscription.
    1. Enter the resource group, or select it if it already exists.
    1. Enter the new project name.
    1. Select a supported geography region that you previously created. For more information, see [Supported geographies](migrate-hyperv-requirements.md#supported-geographies).
