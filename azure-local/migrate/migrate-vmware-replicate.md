# Discover and replicate VMware VMs for migration to Azure Local using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes the discovery and replication phase for VMware virtual machine (VM) migration to Azure Local using Azure Migrate.

[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

For more information on appliances for Azure Migrate and how to manage them, see [Azure Migrate appliance](/azure/migrate/migrate-appliance).

## Before you begin

For both the source VMware vCenter Server and target Azure Local appliances, make sure that the underlying hardware has sufficient resources to support the creation of a Windows Server 2022 VM with a minimum of 16 GB RAM, 80 GB of disk storage (HDD), 8 vCPUs, and an external virtual switch.

Ensure all VMs that you wish to migrate are powered on and have VMware tools installed. Migration will fail if the VMs are not powered on and do not have VMware tools installed.

## Step 1: Create and configure the source VMware appliance

### Generate the project key

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Migrate project and then go to **Servers, databases and webapps**.
1. On the **Migration tools** tile, select **Discover**. Make sure to use the **Migration and Modernization Discover** page for Azure Local. If you use the **Discovery and Assessment Discover** page, Azure Local migrations will be blocked.

1. On the **Discover** page, select **Azure Local** under **Where do you want to migrate to** and then select **Yes, with VMware vSphere Hypervisor** under **Are your machines virtualized** in Azure Migrate.
1. Enter a name for your source appliance and generate the key for the source VMware appliance. For detailed steps, see [Generate the project key](/azure/migrate/how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware#generate-the-project-key).

1. Copy the **Project key** (to a text editor such as Notepad) and save it for later use.
1. You can now **Download the Azure Migrate source appliance** using either a *.ova* file or a *.zip* file. The detailed steps are provided in the subsequent sections.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/migrate-vmware-replicate/generate-source-appliance-project-key-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of going to Discover page." lightbox="./media/migrate-vmware-replicate/generate-source-appliance-project-key-2.png":::

### Create the source appliance

You can install the appliance using either an *.ova* file or a *.zip* file that you download to your VMware host server. <!-- REMOVE For more information on appliances for Azure Migrate and how to manage them, see [Azure Migrate appliance](/azure/migrate/migrate-appliance).-->

#### Install using an .OVA file

This step applies only if you are deploying the source VMware appliance using an *.OVA* file.

1. Once you have downloaded the **.OVA** file, [Verify that the file is secure](/azure/migrate/how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware#verify-security). 
1. [Create the source VMware appliance](/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware#create-the-appliance-server). 
1. [Verify that the appliance can access Azure](/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware#verify-appliance-access-to-azure). <!--check if this is needed-->


#### Install using a .zip file

This step applies only if you downloaded the .zip file. You use the *AzureMigrateInstaller.ps1* PowerShell script to install the source appliance.
For specific information, see [Set up an appliance with a script](/azure/migrate/deploy-appliance-script).

1. Create a VM in the VMware vCenter with the following configuration:
    - Operating system: Windows Server 2022
    - vCPU: 8
    - Disk: >80 GB
    - Memory: 16 GB
    <!--For detailed steps, see [Creating a VM in vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.html.hostclient.doc/GUID-FBEED81C-F9D9-4193-BDCC-CC4A60C20A4E.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIMICcCmYAuSAEA3Alg1ArpBgLZgDGAFjgHZIgC+QA).-->
1. Once the VM is created, sign into the VM as an administrator.
1. Copy the downloaded zip file to the new VM that you created in the vCenter. Extract the zip to a folder and go where the  *AzureMigrateInstaller.ps1* PowerShell script resides in the extracted folder.
1. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    
    .\AzureMigrateInstaller.ps1 -Scenario VMware -Cloud Public -PrivateEndpoint:$falseÂ -EnableAzureStackHCITarget
    ```

1. Select option 1 as the desired configuration: **Primary appliance to discover, assess and migrate servers**.
1. Follow the rest of the onscreen instructions to install the source appliance and uninstall Internet Explorer.
1. Restart the VM after the installation is complete. Sign in to the VM.

### Configure the source appliance and discover VMs

Once the source appliance is installed, follow these steps:

1. [Configure the source appliance](/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware#configure-the-appliance). Complete these steps.
    1.  [Set up the prerequisites and register the source appliance](/azure/migrate/tutorial-discover-vmware#set-up-prerequisites-and-register-the-appliance).

        :::image type="content" source="./media/migrate-vmware-replicate/setup-prereq-register-source-appliance-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of registration of source appliance completed." lightbox="./media/migrate-vmware-replicate/setup-prereq-register-source-appliance-1.png":::

    1. Make sure that the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) is installed. Download and extract the **VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit** in zip format to the provided folder path. Versions 8.0.0, 8.0.1, and 8.0.2 are currently supported. Version 6.7.0 is also supported but the package is deprecated, hence the new deployments are unable to use this version. 

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Do not use VDDK 7.0.X. These versions have known issues and result in errors during migration.

    1. Select **Verify** to make sure that the VMware VDDK is successfully installed.
