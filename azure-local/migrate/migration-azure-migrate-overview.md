# Overview of Azure Migrate based migration for Azure Local (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article provides an overview of how to migrate Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) to your Azure Local instance using Azure Migrate.

Azure Migrate is a central hub for tools to discover, assess, and migrate on-premises servers, apps, and data to the Microsoft Azure cloud. Azure Local is a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) system solution that hosts virtualized Windows and Linux workloads in a hybrid environment. You can use the Azure Migrate platform to move on-premises Hyper-V VMs to your Azure Local instance.

For more information on the Azure Migrate platform, see [About Azure Migrate](/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview).

[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Benefits

Here are the benefits of using Azure Migrate to migrate your on-premises VMs to Azure Local. This solution:

- Requires no preparation for your source VMs including installation of agents prior to migration.
- Provides the control plane via the Azure portal. You can use the portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
- Keeps the data flow local, from on-premises Hyper-V to Azure Local.
- Results in a minimal downtime for the VMs running on your on-premises servers.

## Migration phases

Here are the key phases of the migration process:


|#  |Phase  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1.     |**Prepare**        |Prepare to migrate by completing the migration prerequisites. Deploy, configure, and register your Azure Local instance. This system is the migration target. Create an Azure Migrate project and an Azure Storage account in Azure.<br><br> For more information, see [Review prerequisites for Azure Migrate](migrate-hyperv-prerequisites.md).         |
|2.     |**Discover**       |Create and configure an Azure Migrate source appliance. Use this appliance to discover your on-premises source Hyper-V servers. <br><br> For more information, see [Discover Hyper-V VMs](migrate-hyperv-replicate.md).          |
|3.     |**Replicate**      |Create and configure the target appliance on your Azure Local. Select and replicate the VMs that were discovered in the previous step. <br><br> For more information, see [Replicate Hyper-V VMs](migrate-hyperv-replicate.md).         |
|4.     |**Migrate, verify**|Once the replication is complete, select and migrate VMs to your Azure Local. After the migration is complete, verify that the VMs have booted successfully and the data has migrated properly. You can now pause the replication and decommission the source VMs. <br><br> For more information, see [Migrate and verify Hyper-V VMs](./migrate-azure-migrate.md).         |
