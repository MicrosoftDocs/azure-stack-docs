# Prerequisites for VMware migration to Azure Local using Azure Migrate (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2.md)]

This article describes the prerequisite tasks you need to complete before you begin the process to migrate VMware virtual machines (VMs) to Azure Local. Make sure to [review the requirements](migrate-vmware-requirements.md) for migration if you haven't already.

[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

The following list contains the prerequisites that must be met to migrate VMware VMs to Azure Local. Some prerequisites apply to the source VMware server, some to the target Azure Local instance, and others to both.

|Prerequisite|Applies to|More information|
|--|--|--|
|Open required VMware firewall ports.|source| **3389** – Inbound connections on port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance. <br> **44368** – Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app by using the URL: *https:\//\<appliance-ip-or-name\>:44368*. <br> **443** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 443 to communicate with Azure Migrate services orchestrating replication and migration, and to allow the appliance to communicate with vCenter Server. <br> **902** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 902 for the appliance to replicate data from snapshots of ESXi hosts and send heartbeat traffic to vCenter. <br> **445** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 445 (SMB) to communicate between source and target appliance.|
|Open required Hyper-V firewall ports.|target|**3389** – Inbound connections on port 3389 to allow remote desktop connections to the appliance. <br> **44368** – Inbound connections on port 44368 to remotely access the appliance management app by using the URL: *https:\//\<appliance-ip-or-name\>:44368*. <br> **445** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 445 (SMB) to communicate between source and target appliance. <br> **5985, 5986** – Inbound and outbound connections on port 5985 (WinRM) to communicate from appliance to host.|

## Create an Azure Migrate project

Before you can migrate, create an Azure Migrate project in Azure portal using the following procedure. For more information, see [Create and manage projects](/azure/migrate/create-manage-projects#create-a-project-for-the-first-time).

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Migrate**.

1. On the **Get started** page, under **Servers, databases and web apps**, select **Discover, assess and migrate**.

1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, select **Create project**.

1. On the **Create project** page:
    1. Enter your subscription. Make sure that the chosen subscription is associated with the same Azure tenant as the Azure Local instance.
    1. Enter the resource group, or select it if it already exists.
    1. Enter the new project name.
    1. Select a supported geography region that you previously created. For more information, see [Supported geographies](migrate-vmware-requirements.md#supported-geographies).

1. When finished, select **Create**.
