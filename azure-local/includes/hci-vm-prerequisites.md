- Access to one or more VM images on your Azure Local instance. You can create these VM images by using one of the following procedures:

    - [VM image starting from an image in Azure Marketplace](../manage/virtual-machine-image-azure-marketplace.md).
    - [VM image starting from an image in an Azure Storage account](../manage/virtual-machine-image-storage-account.md).
    - [VM image starting from an image in a local share](../manage/virtual-machine-image-local-share.md).

- A custom location for your Azure Local instance that you use to provision VMs. The custom location shows up on the **Overview** page for your Azure Local instance.
