Azure Stack HCI OS, version 22H2 is already out of support.

- Monthly security and quality updates have stopped.
- Your system continues to work, including registration and repair.
- Billing has continued.
- Microsoft Support is available only for upgrade assistance.

To continue receiving updates, we recommend upgrading your operating system to a newer version [via PowerShell](../upgrade/upgrade-22h2-to-23h2-powershell.md).

If you're running an Azure Stack HCI, version 22H2 stretch cluster or managing the cluster via System Center Virtual Machine Manager, review the [Supported workloads and configurations](../upgrade/about-upgrades-23h2.md#supported-workloads-and-configurations) table for update timelines.
