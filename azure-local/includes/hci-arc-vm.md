> - The recommended way to create and manage VMs on Azure Local is using the [Azure Arc control plane](../manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview.md). However, since the functionality described in this article isn't yet provided by Azure Arc, you can use Windows Admin Center or PowerShell as described in this article. The VMs created this way aren't enabled by Azure Arc, have limited manageability from the Azure Arc control plane, and fewer Azure Hybrid Benefits, including usage of Azure Update Manager at no extra cost.
