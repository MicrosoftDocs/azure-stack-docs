SDN uses a VHDX file containing either the Azure Stack HCI or Windows Server operating system (OS) as a source for creating the SDN virtual machines (VMs).

> [!NOTE]
> The version of the OS in your VHDX must match the version used by the Azure Local Hyper-V machines. This VHDX file is used by all SDN infrastructure components.

Depending on the OS version, download one of the following VHDX files::

- OS version 25398.xxxx: [Download an English-language version of the VHDX file](https://aka.ms/PVvxVBVCVVC).
- OS version 26100.xxxx: [Download an English-language version of the VHDX file](../deploy/download-23h2-software.md?view=azloc-2506&preserve-view=true#download-the-software-from-the-azure-portal).
