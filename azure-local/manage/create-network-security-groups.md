# Create network security groups on Azure Local (preview)

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2506"

This article explains how to create and configure network security groups (NSGs) to manage data traffic flow after you enable network controller on your Azure Local.


[!INCLUDE [important](../includes/hci-preview.md)]


## About NSGs on Azure Local VMs

Use a network security group to manage network traffic between logical networks or VMs on Azure Local. Configure a network security group with security rulesâ€¯that allow or deny either inbound or outbound network traffic. The network security rules control traffic based on:

- Source and destination IP addresses.
- Port numbers.
- Protocols (TCP/UDP).
- Direction (inbound or outbound).

Here is a diagram that shows how network security groups are attached to logical networks and VM network interfaces on Azure Local:

:::image type="content" source="./media/create-network-security-groups/network-security-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of conceptual diagram for network security groups attached to logical networks." lightbox="./media/create-network-security-groups/network-security-groups.png":::


The diagram shows a network setup with two logical networks:

- Logical Network A

    - Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24, VLAN 206
    - Has VM Web at 192.168.1.3.
    - NSG rule lets outbound internet access.
    - VM Web can access the internet.

- Logical Network B

    - Subnet: 192.168.2.0/24, VLAN 310
    - Has VM SQL at 192.168.2.3.
    - NSG rule blocks outbound internet access.
    - VM SQL runs SQL Server locally and isn't exposed to the internet.

In this example, the NSG controls traffic flow between logical networks A and B, and between VM Web and VM SQL. You can apply the NSG to each logical network or network interface to enforce specific security rules. For example, logical network B might allow only traffic over SQL port 1433 from logical network A.

> [!NOTE]
> - The only VMs that are in scope for using NSGs with this feature are Azure Local VMs. These are VMs that were deployed from Azure client interfaces (Azure CLI, Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager). Do not use an Azure Local VM in conjunction with an NSG that is managed and applied from on-premises tools.

## Prerequisites

## Create network security groups and network security rules

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

## Sign in and set subscription

[!INCLUDE [hci-vm-sign-in-set-subscription](../includes/hci-vm-sign-in-set-subscription.md)]


## Create a network security group (NSG)

Create a network security group (NSG) to manage data traffic flow on Azure Local. You can create an NSG by itself or associate it with a network interface or a logical network.

NSGs are available only for static logical networks. DHCP-based logical networks aren't supported.

> [!WARNING]
> NSGs must have at least one network security rule. An empty NSG denies all inbound traffic by default. A VM or logical network associated with this NSG isn't reachable.

1. Set the following parameters in your Azure CLI session.

    ```azurecli
    $resource_group="examplerg"      
    $nsgname="examplensg"     
    $customLocationId="/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourcegroups/examplerg/providers/microsoft.extendedlocation/customlocations/examplecl" 
    $location="eastus"
    ```

    The parameters for network security group creation are tabulated as follows:
    
    | Parameters | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | **name**  |Name for the network security group that you create. Make sure to provide a name that follows the [Rules for Azure resources.](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming#example-names-networking)|
    | **location** |Azure region to associate with your network security group. For example, this could be `eastus`, `westeurope`. <br><br> For ease of management, we recommend that you use the same location as your Azure Local instance.  |
    | **resource-group** |Name of the resource group where you create the network security group. For ease of management, we recommend that you use the same resource group as your Azure Local. |
    | **subscription** |Name or ID of the subscription where your Azure Local is deployed. <!--This could be another subscription you use for your Azure Local VMs.--> |
    | **custom-location** |Custom location associated with your Azure Local. |


1. Run the following command to create a network security group (NSG) on your Azure Local instance.

    ```azurecli
    az stack-hci-vm network nsg create -g $resource_group --name $nsgname --custom-location $customLocationId --location $location  
    ```

1. The command creates a network security group (NSG) with the specified name and associates it with the specified custom location.

## Create a network security rule

After you create a network security group, create network security rules. To apply rules to both inbound and outbound traffic, create two rules.

### Create an inbound security rule

1. Set the following parameters in your Azure CLI session.

    ```azurecli
    $resource_group="examplerg"      
    $nsgname="examplensg"     
    $customLocationId="/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourcegroups/examplerg/providers/microsoft.extendedlocation/customlocations/examplecl" 
    $location="eastus"
    $securityrulename="examplensr" 
    $sportrange="*" 
    $saddprefix="10.0.0.0/24" 
    $dportrange="80" 
    $daddprefix="192.168.99.0/24" 
    $description="Inbound security rule" 
    ```

    The parameters for network security group creation are tabulated as follows:

    | Parameters | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | **name**  | Name for the network security rule that you create for your Azure Local. Make sure to provide a name that follows the [Rules for Azure resources.](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming#example-names-networking)|
    | **nsg-name**  | Name for the network security group that contains this network security rule. Make sure to provide a name that follows the [Rules for Azure resources.](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming#example-names-networking)|
    | **location** |Azure regions as specified by `az locations`. For example, this could be `eastus`, `westeurope`. If the location isn't specified, the resource group location is used. |
    | **resource-group** | Name of the resource group where you create the network security group. For ease of management, we recommend that you use the same resource group as your Azure Local. |
    | **subscription** | Name or ID of the subscription where your Azure Local is deployed. This could be another subscription you use for your Azure Local VMs. |
    | **custom-location** |Use this to provide the custom location associated with your Azure Local where you're creating this network security group. |
    | **direction** | Direction of the rule specifies if the rule applies to incoming or outgoing traffic. Allowed values are outbound or inbound (default). |
    | **source-port-ranges** | Specify the source port range 0 and 65535 to match either an incoming or outgoing packet. The default `*` will specify all source ports. |
    | **source-address-prefixes** | Specify the CIDR or destination IP ranges. The default is `*`.|
    | **destination-address-prefixes** | Specify the CIDR or destination IP ranges. The default is `*`.  |  
    | **destination-port-ranges** | Enter a specific port or a port range that this rule allows or denies. Enter an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port.  |
    | **protocol** | Protocol to match either an incoming or outgoing packet. Acceptable values areÂ `*` (default), **All**,Â **TCP**Â andÂ **UDP**. |
    | **access** | If the above conditions are matched, specify either to allow or block the packet. Acceptable values areÂ **Allow**Â andÂ **Deny** with default being **Allow**. |
    | **priority** | Specify a unique priority for each rule in the collection. Acceptable values areÂ from **100**Â toÂ **4096**. A lower value denotes a higher priority.  |
    | **description** | An optional description for this network security rule. The description is a maximum of 140 characters.  |

1. Run the following command to create an inbound network security rule on your Azure Local instance. This rule blocks all inbound ICMP traffic to Azure Local VMs (except the management ports you want enabled) and allows all outbound access.

    ```azurecli
    az stack-hci-vm network nsg rule create -g $resource_group --nsg-name $nsgname --name $securityrulename --priority 400 --custom-location $customLocationId --access "Deny" --direction "Inbound" --location $location --protocol "*" --source-port-ranges $sportrange --source-address-prefixes $saddprefix --destination-port-ranges $dportrange --destination-address-prefixes $daddprefix --description $description  
    ```

1. The command creates a network security rule and associates it with the specified network security group.

### Create an outbound security rule

Run the following command to create an outbound network security rule that blocks all network traffic.

  ```azurecli
  az stack-hci-vm network nsg rule create -g $resource_group --nsg-name $nsgname --name $securityrulename --priority 500 --custom-location $customLocationId --access "Deny" --direction "Outbound" --location $location --protocol "*" --source-port-ranges $sportrange --source-address-prefixes $saddprefix --destination-port-ranges $dportrange --destination-address-prefixes $daddprefix --description $description
  ```

    1. **Source** - Choose between **IP address** or **Any**. The source specifies the incoming traffic from a specific IP address range that is allowed or denied by this rule.
    1. **Source IP address/CIDR ranges** - Provide an address range using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.99.0/24) or an IP address (for example, 192.168.99.0) if you choose IP address as the source.
    1. **Source port ranges** - Provide a specific port or a port range that will be denied or allowed by this rule. Provide an asterisk* to allow traffic on any port.
    1. **Destination** - Choose between **IP address** or **Any**. The destination specifies the outgoing traffic to a specific IP address range that will be allowed or denied by this rule.
    1. **Destination IP address/CIDR ranges** - Provide an address range using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.99.0/24) or an IP address (for example, 192.168.99.0) if you choose IP address as the destination.
    1. **Destination port ranges** - Provide a specific port or a port range that will be denied or allowed by this rule. Provide an asterisk* to allow traffic on any port.
    1. **Protocol** - Choose a protocol from **Any**, **TCP**, **UDP**, or **ICMP**. The protocol specifies the type of traffic that this rule allows or denies.
    1. **Action** - Choose between **Allow** or **Deny**. The action specifies whether this rule allows or denies matching traffic.
    1. **Priority** - Enter a number between 100 and 4096. The priority specifies the order in which the rules apply. Lower numbers are processed first.
    1. **Name** - Enter a name for the rule. The name must be unique in the network security group.
    1. **Description** - Enter a description for the rule. The description is optional.
1. Select **Add**.

1. **Refresh** the list. The new network security rule appears.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-network-security-rule-5-a.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new network security rule." lightbox="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-network-security-rule-5-a.png":::

## Create default network access policy

Create a default network access policy to block all inbound traffic to Azure Local VMs (except the management ports you want enabled) and allow all outbound access. Use these policies to make sure your VMs have access only to required assets, which helps prevent threats from spreading laterally.

You can attach a default network access policy to Azure Local VM in two ways:
- During VM creation. You need to attach the VM to a logical network. For more information, see [Create a logical network](./create-logical-networks.md).
- Post VM creation.

### Apply default network access policy when creating a VM

While creating a VM, create a network interface and attach a default network access policy to it. 

For more information, see [Create Azure Local VM via Azure portal](./create-arc-virtual-machines.md). In this procedure, when you reach the **Networking** tab, follow these steps to add a default network access policy:

1. On the Networking tab, select **+ Add network interface**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-default-network-access-policy-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing addition of a network interface." lightbox="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-default-network-access-policy-1.png":::

1. In the **Add network interface** page, enter the following information:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-default-network-access-policy-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing network interface NSG options for the new network interface." lightbox="./media/create-network-security-groups/create-default-network-access-policy-1.png":::

    1. **Name** - Enter a name for the network interface.
    1. **Network** - Select a logical network from the list of logical networks available in your Azure Local instance.
    1. IPv4 type - Select **Static** or **Dynamic**. If you select **Static**, enter a static IP address for the VM. If you select **Dynamic**, the system assigns a random IP address from the subnet.
    1. Allocation method: Select Automatic or Manual. If you select Automatic, the system assigns a random IP address from the subnet. If you select Manual, enter a static IP address for the VM.
    1. **NIC Network security group** - Choose one of the following options:
        1. **None** - Select this option if you don't want to enforce any network access policies on your VM. When you select this option, all ports on your VM are exposed to external networks, which poses a security risk. This option isn't recommended.
        1. **Basic** - Select this option to specify a default network access policy. The default policies block all inbound access and allow all outbound access. You can enable inbound access to one or more well defined ports, like HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, or RDP as needed.
        1. **Advanced** - Select this option to specify a network security group.
    1. Select **Add**.
1. Continue with the rest of the VM creation process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default network access policy is available only for the first network interface of the VM. If you add a second network interface, you can't attach the default network access policy to it.

### Apply default network access policy to an existing VM

You can apply a default network access policy to an existing VM.
