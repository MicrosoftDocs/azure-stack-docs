# Get support for Azure Local

[!INCLUDE [hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2](../includes/hci-applies-to-23h2-22h2.md)]

This article provides guidance on how to get support for Azure Local. Azure Local follows the same support process as Azure. Enterprise customers can follow the process described in [Create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). If you're a customer of a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), contact your CSP for support.

Updates for Azure Local are released monthly to enhance customer experience. To keep your Azure Local instance in a supported state, you have up to six months to install updates, but we recommend installing updates as they are released. Microsoft provides monthly quality and security updates for each supported version of Azure Local and quarterly feature releases.

To create an Azure Local support request requires one of the following Azure support plans: Standard, Professional Direct, or Developer. You cannot use the Basic plan.

- [Azure Support Plans FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/)

Get remote support by allowing Microsoft support to access your device remotely and perform limited troubleshooting and repair. For information about how to get remote support, see [Get remote support](get-remote-support.md).
