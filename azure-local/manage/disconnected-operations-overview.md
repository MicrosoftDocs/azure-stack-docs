# Disconnected operations for Azure Local (preview)

Applies to: Azure Local, version 23H2, release 2411 and later

This article describes disconnected operations and how they can be used in the deployment and management of your Azure Local.

[!INCLUDE [IMPORTANT](../includes/disconnected-operations-preview.md)]

## Overview

Disconnected operations for Azure Local enable the deployment and management of Azure Local instances without a connection to the Azure public cloud. This feature allows you to build, deploy, and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containerized applications using select Azure Arc-enabled services from a local control plane, providing a familiar Azure portal and CLI experience.

## Why use disconnected operations?

Here are some scenarios for running Azure Local with disconnected operations:

- **Data sovereignty and compliance**: In sectors like government, healthcare, and finance, there's a necessity to meet data residency or compliance requirements. When operating disconnected, data and control remain within the designated organizational boundaries.

- **Remote or isolated locations**: In areas with limited network infrastructure, such as remote or protected regions, disconnected operations allow you to use Azure Arc services and run workloads without relying on internet connectivity. For example, oil rigs and manufacturing sites.

- **Security**: For industries with stringent security requirements, disconnected operations help reduce the attack surface by not exposing systems to external networks.

## Supported services

Disconnected operations for Azure Local support the following services:

|Service                            | Description                                  |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you review and apply the appropriate hardware and requirements for Azure Local:

- [System requirements for Azure Local](../concepts/system-requirements-23h2.md).
- Validated nodes or higher, see [Azure Local catalog](https://azurestackhcisolutions.azure.microsoft.com/).

The next sections provide details on the hardware, integration, and access requirements to operate disconnected.

### Hardware requirements

The virtual appliance for disconnected operations runs on Azure Local instances. To operate Azure Local with disconnected operations, you need to plan for extra capacity for the virtual appliance. Additionally, you must meet higher minimum hardware requirements to deploy and operate Azure Local with disconnected operations, as it hosts a local control plane.

This checklist provides you with the minimum hardware requirements each node needs to support the disconnected operations virtual appliance. You should factor in extra capacity for VM or AKS workloads in your capacity planning.

| Specification                        | Minimum configuration            |
| -------------------------------------| ---------------------------------|
| Minimum number of nodes              | 3 nodes                          |
| Minimum memory per node              | 64 GB                            |
| Minimum cores per node               | 24 physical cores                |
| Minimum storage per node             | 2 TB SSD/NVME                    |
| Minimum boot drive storage           | 480 GB SSD/NVME                  |
| Network                              | Switchless and Switched are supported: [Network considerations for cloud deployments of Azure Local, version 23H2](../plan/cloud-deployment-network-considerations.md) <br><br> Note: Switchless configurations work for cluster size of three nodes only. |

### Integration requirements

You must integrate with existing datacenter assets that need to be pre-deployed and configured before starting the disconnected operations deployment process.

The following table lists the requirements to successfully deploy and run disconnected operations on Azure Local instances.

| Area          | Supported system         | Use                          |
| --------------| -------------------------| -----------------------------|
| Identity      | Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) on Windows Server 2022 | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provides group membership and synchronization. <br><br> ADFS authenticates users to the Azure Local portal to manage disconnected operations using Open-ID Connect (OIDC). <br><br> Active Directory (AD) is required for disconnected operations. |
| Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)   | Both Private and Public PKI are supported and required <br><br> Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) validated as a Private PKI solution | Issue certificates to secure Azure Local disconnected operations endpoints (TLS). |
| Network Time Protocol (NTP) optional  | Local or Public time server | Time server synchronizes the system clock. |
| Domain Name System (DNS)   | Any DNS server, such as DNS role on Windows Server | DNS service is required in the local network to resolve Azure Local-disconnected operations endpoints and configure ingress IPs. <br><br> When you run the appliance for disconnected operations in a connected mode, a DNS server is required to resolve Microsoft domain names for logging and telemetry. |

- [Design options for ADFS for Windows Server](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-design)

### Access requirements

To successfully configure disconnected operations and create the necessary resources, you need appropriate access and permissions to create and modify the following resources:

| Component   | Access required    |
|-------------|--------------------|
| AD + ADFS   | Create a service account with read access for the organizational unit to facilitate LDAP integration. <br><br> Export the configuration for ADFS (OIDC). |
| DNS         | Access to create DNS records or zones to provide lookups for a disconnected operations endpoint. |
| PKI         | Ability to create and export certificates to secure disconnected operations endpoints (TLS). |
| Network     | Access to the firewall (if a local firewall is implemented) to ensure necessary changes can be done. |
