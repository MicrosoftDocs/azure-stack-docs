# Use Azure Policy in a disconnected Azure Local environment

::: moniker range=">=azloc-2506"

This article explains how to use Azure Policy in a disconnected Azure Local environment to enforce compliance and manage resources at scale. Azure Policy helps organizations meet standards by checking resource properties against business rules, even when disconnected from Azure cloud.

[!INCLUDE [IMPORTANT](../includes/disconnected-operations-preview.md)]

## About using Azure Policy in Azure Local disconnected

Azure Policy helps you meet organizational standards by checking resource properties against business rules. These rules, described in JSON format, are called policy definitions. Assign these rules to scopes like subscriptions or individual resources in the Resource Manager scope. For more information, see [Overview of Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview).

In Azure Local disconnected operations, policy enforcement supports Arc-enabled Kubernetes and Arc-enabled servers. Some built-in policy definitions are included in the Azure Local disconnected operations deployment. Operators turn on these policies by creating policy assignments on the target scope using the disconnected operations portal or CLI. Enforcement depends on the policy type.

## Benefits

Azure Policy for Azure Local disconnected operations lets you enforce policies across all supported Azure services, so you manage and set up resources at scale.

With Azure Policy in a disconnected Azure Local environment, you:

- Ensure resource creation is consistent and compliant.
- Focus on high-sensitivity tasks. Azure Local disconnected operations are ideal for industries with strict regulations, and Azure Policy is essential for the success of the disconnected operations feature.
- Enforce policies across all supported Arc services on disconnected operations.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to an Azure Local instance with Azure Local disconnected operations deployed.
- Review built-in policies.
- Identify the policy definition you want to assign.

For more information, see [Supported built-in policies](#supported-built-in-policies).

## Enable Azure Policy

You can use Azure Policy to enforce tags on various resources. In this example, we've used a built-in policy that enforces tags on resource groups. This prevents the creation of resource groups without the required tag. To enable an Azure Policy, follow these steps:

### Set up the basics

1. Sign in to the Azure Local portal and navigate to **Policy**.

2. Under the **Authoring** section, choose **Assignments**, and then select **+ Assign policy**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/disconnected-operations/azure-policy/assign-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring and assignments page." lightbox="media/disconnected-operations/azure-policy/assign-policy.png":::

3. Identify the **Scope**, **Policy definition**, and **Assignment name**.

4. Toggle the **Policy enforcement** to **Enabled**.

5. Select **Parameters** to proceed to the next step.

### Set the parameters

1. In the **Parameters** section, provide the required **Tag name**.

2. Name your tag and select the **Review + create button**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/disconnected-operations/azure-policy/tag-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the parameters page to set a tag name." lightbox="media/disconnected-operations/azure-policy/tag-name.png":::

    After the policy is created, you can't create resource groups without the required tag.
