# AKS Edge Essentials pricing

AKS Edge Essentials can be licensed via one of the following options:

- Azure subscription-based model
- Volume licensing model (available from April 2023)

You can [review the details of each of the approaches](aks-edge-licensing.md). This article focuses on the Azure subscription-based approach. You can run the AKS Edge Essentials subscription-based Kubernetes offering on Windows Pro, Windows Enterprise, Windows IoT Enterprise, or Windows Server-based devices. You can download and install AKS Edge Essentials on your existing or new hardware that will be deployed on the edge. The pricing is based on usage and requires an Azure subscription, which you can obtain for free.

The billing unit model is based on a device, which can be a physical or virtual device on which AKS Edge Essentials is installed. After you install AKS Edge Essentials on your device and connect your cluster to Azure Arc, a per-device per-month rate is applied. The snapshot of usage is reported during the following month on a date that's one day prior to the date the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster was created. For example, if the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster was created on March 6 with AKS Edge Essentials, the number of devices included in this cluster is captured and submitted for billing on April 5. If you have one device in your cluster when the usage is posted on April 5, you'll be billed for one device usage for this Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster resource by AKS Edge Essentials.
