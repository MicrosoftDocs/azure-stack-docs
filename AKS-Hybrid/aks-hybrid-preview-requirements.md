# System requirements for AKS hybrid cluster provisioing from Azure (preview)

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Azure Stack HCI

This article covers the prerequisites for deploying Azure Arc Resource Bridge and AKS hybrid clusters. For an overview of AKS hybrid cluster provisioing from Azure, see [Overview of AKS hybrid cluster provisioning from Azure](aks-hybrid-preview-overview.md)

## Minimum resource requirements

Azure Arc Resource Bridge has the following resource requirements:
  - A cluster shared volume with at least 50 GB of space
  - At least 4 vCPUs per physical node 
  - At least 8 GB of memory per physical node

## Azure requirements

Make sure that you have your Azure environment set up. Follow this table to ensure you've covered everything you need for a successful installation.

Windows Server or Azure Stack HCI infrastructure admin:

| Prerequisite |  Item  |  Details  |  Value  |
| -- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1 | Do you have an Azure subscription?  | The Azure Arc Resource Bridge, Custom Location, and all AKS hybrid clusters will be deployed in this Azure subscription. |  Make sure you have your Azure subscription ID. |
| 2 | Do you have a recent version of Az CLI installed on all nodes in your physical cluster? | Required to run the Az commands. You need to install Az CLI on all physical nodes in your Windows Server cluster. Follow this link to [install Az CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli). You can upgrade to the latest version by running `az upgrade`. | Verify that you have Az CLI by running `az -v`. |
| 3 | Have you registered all the right providers on your subscription? Make sure you login to Azure first. You only need to do this operation once per Azure subscription.  | Wait till the features in the previous step have been registered before proceeding with this step. You need to register the following providers to use this preview: <br> `az account set -s <subscriptionID from step #1>` <br> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes --wait` <br> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation --wait` <br> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ResourceConnector --wait` <br> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.HybridContainerService --wait`  <br> `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.HybridConnectivity --wait ` | If the status shows *registering*, try again after some time. <br> `az account set -s <subscriptionID from step #1>` <br> `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes -o table` <br> `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation -o table` <br> `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.ResourceConnector -o table` <br> `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.HybridContainerService -o table` <br> `az provider show --namespace Microsoft.HybridConnectivity -o table` | 
| 4 | Did you install the Az CLI extensions on all nodes in your physical cluster? | `az extension add -n k8s-extension` <br> `az extension add -n customlocation` <br> `az extension add -n arcappliance --version 0.2.27` <br> `az extension add -n hybridaks` | You can check if you have the extensions installed and their versions by running the following command: `az -v` <br> Expected output: <br> `azure-cli                         2.40.0` <br> `core                              2.40.0` <br> `telemetry                          1.0.8` <br> Extensions: <br>` arcappliance                      0.2.27` <br> `customlocation                     0.1.3` <br> `hybridaks                     0.2.0` <br> `k8s-extension                      1.3.5` |

## PowerShell module prerequisites

Next, make sure that you download the right versions of PowerShell modules directly on each node in your Windows Server cluster. Open a remote PowerShell session in admin mode on each node in your cluster to download the following PowerShell modules.

Windows Server admin:

| Prerequisite |  Item  |  Details  |  Value  |
| -- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | Did you install the AKS-HCI PowerShell module? | `Install-Module -Name AksHci -Repository PSGallery -RequiredVersion 1.1.39` | Confirm that the AksHci module version is `1.1.39` by running the following command: `Get-Command -Module AksHci` |
| 2 | Did you install the ArcHCI PowerShell module? | `Install-Module -Name ArcHci -Force -Confirm:$false -SkipPublisherCheck -AcceptLicense` | Confirm that the ArcHci module version is atleast `0.2.11` by running the following command: `Get-Command -Module ArcHci` |

## Networking prerequisites

Setting up the right networking requires you to work with the network administrator of your datacenter. You have two options to choose from: static IP and DHCP. We highly recommend using static IP for your Azure Arc Resource Bridge for optimum reliability.

Windows Server admin in consultation with the datacenter network admin:

### Option 1: Static IP networking (Highly recommended)

| Prerequisite |  Item  |  Details  |  Value  |
| -- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | Do you have a static IP subnet? | This subnet will be used for assigning an IP address to the underlying VM of the Azure Arc Resource Bridge. | The IP address prefix of your subnet. For example - "172.16.0.0/16" |
| 2 | Do you have atleast 4 IP addresses in your environment? | You need to ensure that you have atleast 4 available IP addresses in the above subnet. <br> | Ensure and list the range of available IP addresses in your subnet. For example - "172.16.0.3" to "172.16.0.10" |
| 3 | Do you have a gateway? | The IP address of the default gateway of the subnet you provided above.  | The IP address of your gateway. For example - "172.16.0.1" |
| 4 | Do you have one or more DNS servers? | Along with gateway, this is required for creating a network with a static IP. A minimum of one and a maximum of three DNS servers can be provided.  | The IP address(es) of your DNS servers. For example - "172.16.0.2" |
| 5 | Do you have a cloudserviceIP? | You need a cloudserviceIP so that the Azure Arc Resource Bridge can talk to your Windows Server physical nodes. | Enter your cloudserviceIP address. This will be required to install the Azure Arc Resource Bridge. |
| 6 | Do you have an external virtual switch? | You need an external virtual switch for the Azure Arc Resource Bridge. | Name of your virtual switch |
| 7 | Do you have a VLAN ID? | This is an optional parameter. Check with your network administrator if the subnet you provided above is tagged. | The VLAN ID. For example - 7 |

### Option 2: DHCP networking

| Prerequisite |  Item  |  Details  |  Value  |
| -- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | Do you have a DHCP server with atleast 3 IP addresses in your environment? | This DHCP server will be used to assign an IP address to the underlying VM of the Azure Arc Resource Bridge. | Check with your admin if your Windows Server network environment has a DHCP server. |
| 2 | Do you have atleast 2 IP addresses in the same subnet as the DHCP server but excluded from the DHCP scope? | You need 2 IP addresses in the same subnet as the DHCP server but excluded from the DHCP scope. <br> Apart from 3 required IP addresses in the DHCP server, we also need to statically assign IP addresses to some important agents, so they are long lived. | List of atleast 2 IP addresses in the same subnet as the DHCP server but excluded from the DHCP scope. |
| 3 | Do you have an external virtual switch? | You need an external virtual switch for the underlying VM of the Azure Arc Resource Bridge. | Name of your virtual switch |
| 4 | Do you have a cloudserviceIP? | You need a cloudserviceIP so that Azure Arc Resource Bridge can talk to your Windows Server physical nodes. | Enter your cloudserviceIP address. |
| 5 | Do you have a VLAN ID? | This is an optional parameter. Check with your network administrator if the subnet you provided above is tagged. | The VLAN ID. For example - 7 |

### Proxy settings

| Prerequisite |  Item  |  Details 
| -- | ----- | ------- |
| 1 | HTTP URL and port information |  Check with your network admin if your Windows Server or Azure Stack HCI network environment is behind a proxy server. If yes, obtain the HTTP URL and port information from your network admin. It should be of the following format - `http://proxy.corp.contoso.com:8080`.  |
| 2 | HTTPS URL and port information | Check with your network admin if your Windows Server or Azure Stack HCI network environment is behind a proxy server. If yes, obtain the HTTPS URL and port information from your network admin. It should be of the following format - `https://proxy.corp.contoso.com:8443`. You can reuse the HTTP URL and port information here if you do not have HTTPS URL and port information. |
| 3 | [Optional] Valid credentials for authentication to the proxy server | You can either use a PowerShell credential object containing the username and password to authenticate against the proxy server or a filename or certificate string of a PFX formatted client certificate used to authenticate against the proxy server. |

#### Noproxy settings

The following table contains the list of addresses that must be excluded:

|      **IP Address**       |    **Reason for exclusion**    |  
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | 
| localhost, 127.0.0.1  | Localhost traffic  |
| .svc | Internal Kubernetes service traffic (.svc) where _.svc_ represents a wildcard name. This is similar to saying \*.svc, but none is used in this schema. |
| 10.0.0.0/8 | private network address space |
| 172.16.0.0/12 |Private network address space - Kubernetes Service CIDR |
| 192.168.0.0/16 | Private network address space - Kubernetes Pod CIDR |
| **Your enterprise namespace** | You may want to exempt your enterprise namespace (for example, .contoso.com) from being directed through the proxy. To exclude all addresses in a domain, you must add the domain to the `noProxy` list. Use a leading period rather than a wildcard (\*) character. In the sample, the addresses `.contoso.com` excludes addresses `prefix1.contoso.com`, `prefix2.contoso.com`, and so on. |

The default value for `noProxy` is `localhost,127.0.0.1,.svc,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16`. While these default values will work for many networks, you may need to add more subnet ranges and/or names to the exemption list. For example, you may want to exempt your enterprise namespace (for example, .contoso.com) from being directed through the proxy. You can achieve that by specifying the values in the `noProxy` list.

### Network port requirements

If the Windows Server physical cluster nodes and the Azure Arc Resource Bridge VM are on two isolated vlans, these ports need to be opened at the Firewall between.

| Port   | Source                               | Description                                        | Firewall Notes                                                                               |
|-------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 22    | Azure Arc Resource Bridge VM                             | Required to collect logs when using Get-ArcHciLogs | If using separate VLANs, the physical Hyper-V Hosts need to access the Azure Arc Resource Bridge VM on this port. |
| 6443  | Azure Arc Resource Bridge VM                             | Required to communicate with Kubernetes APIs       | If using separate VLANs, the physical Hyper-V Hosts need to access the Azure Arc Resource Bridge VM on this port. |
