#Customer intent: As an AKS user, I want to use the diagnostic checker to run diagnostic checks on my AKS cluster to find out common causes for AKS cluster create failure.

# Use diagnostic checker to diagnose and fix environment issues for AKS cluster creation failure (preview)

It can be difficult to identify environment-related issues, such as networking configurations, that can result in an AKS cluster creation failure. The diagnostic checker is a PowerShell-based tool that can help identify AKS cluster creation failures due to potential issues in the environment.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only use the diagnostic checker tool if an AKS cluster was created, but is in a failed state. You can't use the tool if you don't see an AKS cluster on the Azure portal. If the AKS cluster creation fails before an Azure Resource Manager resource is created, [file a support request](aks-troubleshoot.md#open-a-support-request).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites. If you don't meet the requirements for running the diagnostic checker tool, [file a support request](aks-troubleshoot.md#open-a-support-request):

- Direct access to the Azure Stack HCI cluster where you created the AKS cluster. This access can be through remote desktop (RDP), or you can also sign in to one of the Azure Stack HCI physical nodes.
- Review the [networking concepts for creating an AKS cluster](aks-hci-network-system-requirements.md) and the [AKS cluster architecture](cluster-architecture.md).
- The name of the logical network attached to the AKS cluster.
- An SSH private key for the AKS cluster, used to sign in to the AKS cluster [control plane node](cluster-architecture.md#control-plane-nodes) VM.

## Obtain control plane node VM IP of the AKS cluster

Run the following command from any one physical node in your Azure Stack HCI cluster. Ensure that you're passing the name, and not the Azure Resource Manager ID of the AKS cluster:

```powershell
invoke-command -computername (get-clusternode) -script {get-vmnetworkadapter -vmname *} | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "$cluster_name*control-plane-*"} | select vmname, ipaddresses
```

Expected output:

```output
VMName                                                 IPAddresses
------                                                 -----------
<cluster-name>-XXXXXX-control-plane-XXXXXX {172.16.0.10, 172.16.0.4, fe80::ec:d3ff:fea0:1}
```

If you don't see a control plane VM as shown in the previous output, [file a support request](aks-troubleshoot.md#open-a-support-request).

If you see a control plane VM, and it has:

- 0 IPv4 addresses: file a [support request](aks-troubleshoot.md#open-a-support-request).
- 1 IP address: use the IPv4 address as the input for `vmIP` parameter.
- 2 IP addresses: use any one of the IPv4 address as an input for `vmIP` parameter in the diagnostic checker.

## Run the diagnostic checker script

Copy the following PowerShell script `run_diagnostic.ps1` into any one node of your Azure Stack HCI cluster:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Runs diagnostic checker tool in target cluster control plane VM and returns the result.

    This script runs the following tests from target cluster control plane VM:
    1. cloud-agent-connectivity-test: Checks whether the DNS server can resolve the Moc cloud agent FQDN and that the cloud agent is reachable from the control plane node VM. Cloud agent is created using one of the IP addresses from the [management IP pool](hci/plan/cloud-deployment-network-considerations.md#management-ip-pool), on port 55000. The control plane node VM is given an IP address from the Arc VM logical network.
    2. gateway-icmp-ping-test: Checks whether the gateway specified in the logical network attached to the AKS cluster is reachable from the AKS cluster control plane node VM.
    3. http-connectivity-required-url-test: Checks whether the required URLs are reachable from the AKS cluster control plane node VM.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script transfers a file from the local machine to a remote server using the SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) command.

.PARAMETER lnetName
    The name of the LNET used for the cluster.

.PARAMETER sshPath
    The path to the private SSH key for the target cluster.

.PARAMETER vmIP
    IP of the target cluster control plane VM.


.EXAMPLE
    .\run_diagnostic.ps1 -lnetName lnet1 -sshPath C:\Users\test\.ssh\test-ssh.pem -vmIP "172.16.0.10"
    This example runs diagnostic checker tool in the VM with IP 172.16.0.10 using ssh key C:\Users\test\.ssh\test-ssh.pem and outputs the result.

## Next steps

If the problem persists, collect [AKS cluster logs](get-on-demand-logs.md) before [creating a support request](aks-troubleshoot.md#open-a-support-request).
