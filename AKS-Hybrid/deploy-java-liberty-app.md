# Deploy Java app with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

This article demonstrates how to:  

* Run your Java, Java EE, Jakarta EE, or MicroProfile application on the Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty runtime.
* Build the application Docker image using Open Liberty container images.
* Deploy the containerized application to an on-premises AKS cluster in AKS enabled by Arc using the Open Liberty Operator.

The Open Liberty Operator simplifies the deployment and management of applications running on Kubernetes clusters. With Open Liberty Operator, you can also perform more advanced operations, such as gathering traces and dumps.

For more information about Open Liberty, see [the Open Liberty project page](https://openliberty.io/). For more information about IBM WebSphere Liberty, see [the WebSphere Liberty product page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty).

This article is divided into two parts:

**Part 1** focuses on deploying the necessary artifacts in Azure. This deployment includes a resource group and Azure Container Registry. To perform these tasks, you can use either [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) (easiest), which includes the latest version of Azure CLI, or a local system with the following tools installed:

* A Unix-like operating system installed (for example, Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux).
* Install Azure CLI following the previous guidance.
* Install a Java SE implementation (for example, [AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK 8 LTS/OpenJ9](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)).
* Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

**Part 2** focuses on deploying the application from your Azure Container Registry down into the AKS Arc environment. For this section, you cannot use Azure Cloud Shell. For the AKS Arc environment, the following items are required:

* An [AKS cluster](./setup.md) with at least one Linux worker node that's up and running.
* A configured local `kubectl` environment that points to your AKS cluster. You can use the [Get-AksHciCredential](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) PowerShell command to access your cluster using `kubectl`.
* Git command-line tools installed on your system. On a Windows system, you can use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as the main console, and within the Git Bash console, call PowerShell and Azure when required.

## Create a resource group in Azure

An *Azure resource group* is a logical group into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

You can create a resource group called **java-liberty-project** when you use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command in the **eastus** location. This resource group is used later for creating the Azure Container Registry instance:

```azurecli
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=java-liberty-project
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus
```

## Create a Container Registry instance in Azure

Use the [az acr create](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-create) command to create the Azure Container Registry instance. The following example creates a Container Registry instance named **youruniquecontainerregistryname**. Make sure **youruniquecontainerregistryname** is unique within Azure:

```azurecli
REGISTRY_NAME=youruniquecontainerregistryname
az acr create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $REGISTRY_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled
```

After a short time, you should see JSON output that looks similar to the following example:

```output
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
"publicNetworkAccess": "Enabled",
"resourceGroup": "java-liberty-project",
```

### Connect to the Container Registry instance in Azure

You must sign in to the Container Registry instance before you can push an image to it. Run the following commands to verify the connection. Make a note of your login details. You use those later when connecting to AKS:

```azurecli
LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'loginServer' -o tsv)
USER_NAME=$(az acr credential show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'username' -o tsv)
PASSWORD=$(az acr credential show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query 'passwords[0].value' -o tsv)

echo $LOGIN_SERVER
echo $USER_NAME
echo $PASSWORD

docker login $LOGIN_SERVER -u $USER_NAME -p $PASSWORD
```

You should see **Login Succeeded** at the end of the command output if you've logged into the Container Registry instance successfully.

## Build application image in Azure

To deploy and run your Liberty application on the AKS cluster, you must first containerize your application as a Docker image using [Open Liberty container images](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker) or [WebSphere Liberty container images](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker):

1. Clone the sample code for this guide. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks).
1. Change directory to `javaee-app-simple-cluster` of your local clone.
1. Run `mvn clean package` to package the application.
1. Run `mvn liberty:dev` to test the application. You should see **The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet** in the command output if the command was successful. Use **CTRL-C** to stop the application.
1. Run one of the following commands to build the application image and push it to the Container Registry instance:
   * Build with the Open Liberty base image if you prefer to use Open Liberty as a lightweight open source Java runtime:

     ```azurecli
     # Build and tag application image. This causes the Container Registry instance to pull the necessary Open Liberty base images.
     az acr build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 -r $REGISTRY_NAME .
     ```

   * Build with the WebSphere Liberty base image if you prefer to use a commercial version of Open Liberty:

     ```azurecli
     # Build and tag application image. This causes the Container Registry instance to pull the necessary WebSphere Liberty base images.
     az acr build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 -r $REGISTRY_NAME --file=Dockerfile-wlp .
     ```

### Connect to your AKS cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), the Kubernetes command line client. Once it's installed on Windows, you can run `kubectl` from the command prompt, PowerShell console, and Git Bash.

As a prerequisite, you should configure your local `kubectl` environment to point to your AKS cluster. You can use the [Get-AksHciCredential](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) PowerShell command to access your cluster using `kubectl`:

```powershell
Get-AksHciCredential -name AksHciClusterName
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding command uses the default location for the [Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/), which is **%USERPROFILE%\.kube**. You can specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using the `-outputLocation` parameter.

Back in your console, to verify the connection to your cluster, use the [kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command to return a list of the cluster nodes:

```console
kubectl get nodes
```

The following example output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure the status of the node is **Ready**:

```output
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyy   Ready    agent   76s     v1.18.10
```

## Install Open Liberty Operator

After creating the cluster and connecting to it, install the [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/master/deploy/releases/0.7.0) by running the following commands:

```console
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=default
WATCH_NAMESPACE='""'

# Install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for OpenLibertyApplication
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/openliberty-app-crd.yaml

# Install cluster-level role-based access
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/openliberty-app-cluster-rbac.yaml \
      | sed -e "s/OPEN_LIBERTY_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE/${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}/" \
      | kubectl apply -f -

# Install the operator
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/openliberty-app-operator.yaml \
      | sed -e "s/OPEN_LIBERTY_WATCH_NAMESPACE/${WATCH_NAMESPACE}/" \
      | kubectl apply -n ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

## Deploy application on the AKS cluster

Follow these steps to deploy the Liberty application on the AKS cluster. You must retrieve your login details from your [earlier session](#connect-to-the-container-registry-instance-in-azure):

1. If you used Azure Cloud Shell earlier, and are now using a separate console to connect to AKS, you must specify your credentials again:

   ```console
   LOGIN_SERVER=YourLoginServerFromEarlier
   USER_NAME=YourUsernameFromEarlier
   PASSWORD=YourPwdFromEarlier
   ```

1. Create a pull secret so that the AKS cluster is authenticated to pull the image from the Container Registry instance:

   ```console
   kubectl create secret docker-registry acr-secret \
      --docker-server=${LOGIN_SERVER} \
      --docker-username=${USER_NAME} \
      --docker-password=${PASSWORD}
   ```

1. Again, if you used Azure Cloud Shell earlier, and you're now using a separate tool or session to connect to AKS, you must clone the sample code for this guide. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks).
1. Verify the current working directory is **javaee-app-simple-cluster** in your local clone.
1. Run the following commands to deploy your Liberty application with three replicas to the AKS cluster. Command output is also shown inline:

   ```console
   # Create OpenLibertyApplication "javaee-app-simple-cluster"
   cat openlibertyapplication.yaml | sed -e "s/\${Container_Registry_URL}/${LOGIN_SERVER}/g" | sed -e "s/\${REPLICAS}/3/g" | kubectl apply -f -

   openlibertyapplication.openliberty.io/javaee-app-simple-cluster created

   # Check if OpenLibertyApplication instance is created
   kubectl get openlibertyapplication javaee-app-simple-cluster

   NAME                        IMAGE                                                   EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
   javaee-app-simple-cluster   youruniquecontainerregistryname.azurecr.io/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0             True         59s

   # Check if deployment created by Operator is ready
   kubectl get deployment javaee-app-simple-cluster --watch

   NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   javaee-app-simple-cluster   0/3     3            0           20s
   ```

1. Wait until you see **3/3** in the **READY** column and **3** in the **AVAILABLE** column. Then you can use **CTRL-C** to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

### Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes load balancer service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a while to complete.

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command with the `--watch` argument.

```console
kubectl get service javaee-app-simple-cluster --watch

NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
javaee-app-simple-cluster   LoadBalancer   10.109.118.3   192.168.0.152   80:30580/TCP     68s
```

Once the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from **pending** to an actual public IP address, use **CTRL-C** to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service (**192.168.0.152** in this example) to see the application home page. You should see the pod name of your application replicas displayed at the top left of the page. Wait for a few minutes, and then refresh the page to see a different pod name displayed as a result of load balancing provided by the AKS cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the application doesn't use HTTPS. You should [enable TLS with your own certificates](/azure/aks/ingress-own-tls).

## Clean up the resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources. When you no longer need the cluster, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to remove the resource group, container registry, and related Azure resources:

```azurecli
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=java-liberty-project
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --yes --no-wait
```

To clean up the resources deployed on AKS, run the following commands from your local console:

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/openliberty-app-crd.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/master/deploy/releases/0.7.1/openliberty-app-operator.yaml
kubectl delete -f openlibertyapplication.yaml
```
