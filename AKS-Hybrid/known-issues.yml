          When running AksHci PowerShell cmdlets, an "Unable to Load DLL" error appears

        answer: | 
          Antivirus software may be causing this error by blocking the execution of PowerShell binaries that are required to perform cluster operations. An example of a similar error is shown below:
          
          [ ![Deployment: Connecting to remote server localhost failed.](media/known-issues/get-akshcicluster-error.png) ](media/known-issues/get-akshcicluster-error.png#lightbox)
          
          To resolve this issue, verify the following processes and folders (which are required to perform AKS cluster operations) are excluded from the antivirus software:
          
          Processes:
          - kubectl.exe
          - kvactl.exe
          - mocctl.exe
          - nodectl.exe
          - wssdagent.exe
          - wssdcloudagent.exe
          - kubectl-adsso.exe
          - AksHciHealth.exe
          
          Folders:
          - C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\
          - C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\TraceProvider\
          - C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AksHci\

          - C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Microsoft.SME.CredSspPolicy\

      - question: | 
          Running Remove-AksHciCluster results in the error: 'Error: unable to delete group clustergroup-spdb:...'

        answer: | 
          When running [Remove-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/remove-akshcicluster.md), the following error occurs because there may be a deadlock:
          
          `Error: unable to delete group clustergroup-spdb: failed to delete group clustergroup-spdb: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded`
          
          To resolve this issue, restart CloudAgent.
      - question: | 
          Error: invalid_client. The provided client secret keys are expired

        answer: | 
          This error usually occurs when service principal (SPN) secret you used when running the PowerShell cmdlet running **Enable-AksHciArcConnection** expired. 
          
          Visit the Azure portal to create a new secret for your service principal (SPN). You can also use [certificate credentials for added security](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials). For an example of using the cmdlet, see [Enable-AksHciArcConnection](./reference/ps/enable-akshciarcconnection.md).
      - question: | 
          Insufficient privileges to complete the operation

        answer: | 
          This error usually occurs when the service principal (SPN) or your Azure credentials (username and password) used to connect your AKS cluster don't have sufficient privileges in the Azure subscription to perform the operation.
          
          Review the privilege requirements in [Azure requirements for AKS clusters in AKS hybrid](/azure/aks/hybrid/system-requirements#azure-requirements).
      - question: | 
          Running Remove-AksHciCluster results in the error: 'A workload cluster with the name 'my-workload-cluster' was not found'

        answer: | 
          XXX
          
          If you encounter this error when running [Remove-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/remove-akshcicluster.md), you should check to make sure you have used the correct information for removing the cluster.
      - question: | 
          Transport: Error while dialing dial unix /var/run/moc-kms-plugin/kmsPlugin.sock: connect: no such file or directory

        answer: | 
          This error happens when the KMS plugin on your AKS-HCI target cluster has stopped running because of an expired KMS plugin token. 
          
          Run [Repair-AksHciCerts](./reference/ps/repair-akshcicerts.md) to fix this issue.
      - question: | 
          In a workload cluster with static IP addresses, all pods in a node are stuck in a 'ContainerCreating' state

        answer: | 
          In a workload cluster with static IP addresses and Windows nodes, all of the pods in a node (including the `daemonset` pods) are stuck in a _ContainerCreating_ state. When attempting to connect to that node using SSH, the connection fails with a `Connection timed out` error.
          
          To resolve this issue, use Hyper-V Manager or Failover Cluster Manager to turn off the VM of that node. After 5 to 10 minutes, the node should have been recreated and with all the pods running.
