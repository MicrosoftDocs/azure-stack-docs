## Description
Enables Arc connection for an AKS on Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server cluster.

## Examples

### Connect an AKS on Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server cluster to Azure Arc for Kubernetes using Azure user login 
This command connects your workload cluster to Azure Arc using the subscription ID and resource group passed in the `Set-AksHciRegistration` command while registering the AKS host for billing. Make sure that you have access to the subscription on an "Owner" role. You can check your access level by navigating to your subscription, clicking on "Access control (IAM)" on the left hand side of the Azure portal and then clicking on "View my access". 


```PowerShell
Connect-AzAccount
Enable-AksHciArcConnection -name "myCluster"
```

### Connect an AKS on Azure Stack HCI and Windows Server cluster to Azure Arc for Kubernetes using a service principal
If you do not have access to a subscription on which you're an "Owner", you can connect your AKS cluster to Azure Arc using a service principal.



The first command prompts for service principal credentials and stores them in the `credential` variable. Enter your application ID for the username and service principal secret as the password when prompted. Make sure you get these values from your subscription admin. The second command connects your cluster to Azure Arc using the service principal credentials stored in the `credential` variable. 


```powershell
$Credential = Get-Credential
Enable-AksHciArcConnection -name "myCluster" -subscriptionId "3000e2af-000-46d9-0000-4bdb12000000" -resourceGroup "myAzureResourceGroup" -credential $Credential -tenantId "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" -location "eastus"
```

Make sure the service principal used in the command above has the "Owner", "Contributor" or "Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding" role assigned to them and that it has scope over the subscription ID and resource group used in the command. For more information on service principals, visit [creating service principals with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps?&preserve-view=true).
