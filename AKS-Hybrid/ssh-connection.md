# Connect with SSH to Windows or Linux worker nodes for maintenance and troubleshooting in AKS hybrid

You may need to access Windows or Linux worker nodes in AKS hybrid for maintenance, log collection, or other troubleshooting operations. For security purposes, you'll need to create a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) connection to access the Windows or Linux worker nodes. To use SSH, you sign in using the node's IP address.

This article describes how to create an SSH connection to access both Windows and Linux nodes.

## Use SSH to connect to Windows worker nodes

To use SSH to sign in to a Windows worker node, run `kubectl get` to obtain the IP address of your node and capture the `EXTERNAL-IP` value.

> [!NOTE]
> You must pass the right location to your SSH private key. The following example uses the default location of %systemdrive%\akshci\.ssh\akshci_rsa, but you may need to change this location if you requested a different path. To do this, specify the `-sshPublicKey` parameter for [Set-AksHciConfig](./reference/ps/set-akshciconfig.md).

To obtain the IP address of the Windows worker node, run the following command:  

```
kubectl --kubeconfig=yourkubeconfig get nodes -o wide
```  

Next, run `ssh Administrator@ip` to connect to a Windows node:  

```
ssh -i $env:SYSTEMDRIVE\AksHci\.ssh\akshci_rsa administrator@<IP Address of the Node>
```
  
After you use SSH to connect to the node, you can run `net user administrator *` to update your administrator password. 

## Use SSH to connect to Linux worker nodes

To use SSH to sign in to a Linux worker node, first run `kubectl get` to obtain the IP address of your node and capture the `EXTERNAL-IP` value.

> [!NOTE]
> You must pass the right location to your SSH private key. The following example uses the default location of %systemdrive%\akshci\.ssh\akshci_rsa, but you may need to change this location if you requested a different path. To do this, specify the `-sshPublicKey` parameter for [Set-AksHciConfig](./reference/ps/set-akshciconfig.md).

To obtain the IP address of the Linux worker node:  

```
kubectl --kubeconfig=yourkubeconfig get nodes -o wide
```  

Use `ssh clouduser@ip` to connect to the Linux node: 

```
ssh -i $env:SYSTEMDRIVE\AksHci\.ssh\akshci_rsa clouduser@<IP Address of the Node>
```  

After you use SSH to connect to the node, you can run `net user administrator *` to update your administrator password.
