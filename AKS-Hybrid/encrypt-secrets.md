# Encrypt etcd secrets for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to monitor and troubleshoot the encryption of etcd secrets for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) management clusters and workload clusters in AKS hybrid.

A *secret* in Kubernetes is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data, such as passwords and SSH keys. In the Kubernetes API server, secrets are stored in _etcd_, which is a highly available key values store used as the Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data. AKS hybrid comes with encryption of etcd secrets and automates the management and rotation of encryption keys.

## Monitor and troubleshoot

To simplify application deployment on Kubernetes clusters, review the [documentation and scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps) that are available.

- To set up logging using Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, and Kibana, follow the steps to [install the tools and set up logging](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Logging).
- To use the monitoring tool Prometheus, follow the steps to [install Prometheus in a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Monitoring#certs-and-keys-monitoring).

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the logs on the control plane node under `/var/log/pods`.
