# Uninstall an AKS Edge Essentials cluster

Follow the steps in this article to uninstall AKS Edge Essentials.

## Disconnect from Azure Arc

If you used `Connect-AideArcKubernetes` to connect to Azure Arc, run `Disconnect-AideArcKubernetes` to disconnect your cluster from Azure Arc. For a complete clean-up, delete the service principal and resource group you created for this example.

```powershell
Disconnect-AideArcKubernetes
```

If you used `Connect-AksEdgeArc` to connect to Arc, run `Disconnect-AksEdgeArc` to disconnect your cluster from Azure Arc.

```powershell
Disconnect-AksEdgeArc -JsonConfigFilePath .\aksedge-config.json
```

You can also manually remove the cluster from Arc using the Azure portal and delete the arc pods in the cluster.

## Remove your application from cluster

Delete the applications that you deployed using the following command.

```powershell
kubectl delete -f ./path-to-your-YAML-file/app.yaml
```

For example, if you deployed the sample Linux application, you can delete it using:

```powershell
kubectl delete -f linux-sample.yaml
```

## Remove nodes on a single-machine cluster

To remove the Windows node only,

```powershell
Remove-AksEdgeNode -nodeType Windows
```

To remove your single machine cluster with a `Linux` or `LinuxandWindows` workload run:

```powershell
Remove-AksEdgeDeployment
(or)
Remove-AksEdgeDeployment -Force #to forcefully remove all.
```

You can't remove the Linux node alone in this configuration, you must remove the deployment if you need to remove Linux node.

> [!NOTE]
> If your single machine cluster doesn't clean up properly, run `hnsdiag list networks`, then delete any existing AKS edge network objects using `hnsdiag delete networks <ID>`.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a known issue in which repeatedly creating a new deployment and removing the node may result in an "error during ConnectToVirtualMachine". If this occurs, reboot your system to resolve the error.

## Remove nodes on a multi-machine cluster

Be careful when removing control plane nodes and make sure you have another working control plane node before doing so.

To remove a **Windows** only node:

```powershell
Remove-AksEdgeNode -NodeType Windows
```

To remove a **Linux** only node:

```powershell
Remove-AksEdgeNode -NodeType Linux
```

During the removal of a **control plane node** from a cluster, it's crucial for the cluster administrator to verify that the cluster has completed reconciliation and the removed node no longer serves as the leader.

You can verify this by running `kubectl get leases -A` and checking until the removed node is no longer a lease holder in the output. This is vital for maintaining cluster stability.

To remove both nodes:

```powershell
Remove-AksEdgeDeployment
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is a known issue in which repeatedly creating a new deployment and removing the node can result in an error. If this occurs, reboot your system to resolve the error.

## Uninstall AKS edge

On your machine, go to **Settings > Apps > Apps & Features**. Alternatively, you can also go to **Control Panel > Uninstall a Program**. From there, look for **Azure Kubernetes Service Edge Essentials (Public Preview)**. Click **Uninstall**.

> [!NOTE]
> You may want to reboot your machine right after the uninstall so that all resources are cleaned and your machine is ready for a new installation in the future.
