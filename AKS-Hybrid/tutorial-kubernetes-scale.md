# Tutorial: Scale applications in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

If you have completed the previous tutorials, you should have a working Kubernetes cluster in AKS hybrid and also deployed the sample Azure Voting app. 

This tutorial, part five of seven, describes how to scale out the pods in the app. You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Scale the Kubernetes nodes
> * Manually scale Kubernetes pods that run your application

In later tutorials, the Azure Vote application is updated to a new version.

## Before you begin

Previous tutorials described how to package an application into a container image, upload the image to Azure Container Registry, and create an AKS cluster. The application was then deployed to the AKS cluster. If you haven't completed these steps, start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare an application for AKS hybrid](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-application.md).


## Manually scale pods

Previous tutorials described how to deploy the Azure Vote front-end and Redis instance in order to create a single replica. To see the number and state of pods in your cluster, use the following [kubectl get][kubectl-get] command:

```console
kubectl get pods
```

The following example output shows one front-end pod and one back-end pod:

```output
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-2549686872-4d2r5   1/1       Running   0          31m
azure-vote-front-848767080-tf34m   1/1       Running   0          31m
```

To manually change the number of pods in the *azure-vote-front* deployment, use the [kubectl scale][kubectl-scale] command. The following example increases the number of front-end pods to *5*:

```console
kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/azure-vote-front
```

Run [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] again to verify that the command successfully created the additional pods. After a minute or so, the pods are available in your cluster:

```console
kubectl get pods

                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
azure-vote-back-2606967446-nmpcf    1/1       Running   0          15m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-2hfh0   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-bzt05   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-fvcvm   1/1       Running   0          3m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-hrbf2   1/1       Running   0          15m
azure-vote-front-3309479140-qphz8   1/1       Running   0          3m
```

## Scale the worker nodes in the node pool

If you created your Kubernetes cluster using the commands in the previous tutorial, your deployment has a cluster called *mycluster* with one Linux node pool called *linuxnodepool*, which has a node count of 1. 

Use the [Set-AksHciNodePool](./reference/ps/set-akshcinodepool.md) command to scale the node pool. The following example scales the node pool from 1 to 3 Linux nodes.

```powershell
Set-AksHciNodePool -clusterName mycluster -name linuxnodepool -count 3
``` 

If you want to scale the control plane nodes, use the [Set-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/set-akshcicluster.md) command.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Set-AksHciNodePool](/azure-stack/aks-hci/reference/ps/set-akshcinodepool) command is used to scale worker nodes in a node pool. In earlier AKS versions, which didn't support node pools in workload clusters, the [Set-AksHciCluster](/azure-stack/aks-hci/reference/ps/set-akshcicluster) command was used. You can only use `Set-AksHciCluster` to scale worker nodes in clusters created with the old parameter set in [New-AksHciCluster](/azure-stack/aks-hci/reference/ps/new-akshcicluster).

Run the following command to confirm that scaling was successful.

```powershell
Get-AksHciNodePool -clusterName mycluster
```

**Output**
```
ClusterName  : mycluster
NodePoolName : linuxnodepool
Version      : v1.20.7
OsType       : Linux
NodeCount    : 3
VmSize       : Standard_K8S3_v1
Phase        : Deployed
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you used different scaling features in your AKS cluster. You learned how to:

> * Manually scale Kubernetes pods that run your application
> * Manually scale the Kubernetes nodes

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to update an application in Kubernetes.
