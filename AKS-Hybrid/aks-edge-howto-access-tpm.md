# TPM access for AKS Edge Essentials

A [Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-top-node) chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. This technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. You can enable or disable the TPM passthrough feature that enables the AKS Edge Essentials virtual machine to use the Windows host OS TPM. The TPM passthrough feature provides read-only access to cryptographic keys stored inside the TPM.

This article describes how to develop sample code in C# to read cryptographic keys stored inside the device's discrete TPM.

> [!NOTE]
> Access to the TPM keys is limited to read-only. If you want to write keys to the TPM, you must do it from within the Windows host OS.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows host OS with a TPM or vTPM (if you're using a Windows host OS virtual machine).

- Enable TPM access from the CBL-Mariner virtual machine with TPM passthrough enabled. In your **aksedge-config** file, in the `machines` section, set the `Machine.LinuxNode.TpmPassthrough` value to `True`. You can only enable or disable TPM access when creating a new deployment. Once you set the flag, it can't be changed unless you remove the deployment or node.

- Ensure that the Non-Volatile(NV) index (default index=3001) is initialized with 8 bytes of data. The default **AuthValue** used by the sample is **{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}**, which corresponds to the NV (Windows) sample in the **TSS.MSR** libraries when writing to the TPM. All index initialization must take place on the Windows host before reading from the CBL-Mariner VM. For more information about TPM samples, see [TSS.MSR](https://github.com/microsoft/TSS.MSR).

> [!CAUTION]
> Enabling TPM passthrough to the virtual machine might increase security risks.

## Create a sample TPM executable

The following steps show how to create a sample executable to access a discrete TPM (dTPM) index from the CBL-Mariner VM.

1. Open Visual Studio 2019 or 2022. Select **Create a new project**. Select **Console App** in the list of templates, then select **Next**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/vs-new-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Visual Studio create new solution." lightbox="media/aks-edge/vs-new-solution.png":::

1. Type the **Project Name**, **Location** and **Solution Name** fields, then select **Next**.

1. Choose a target framework. The latest .NET 6.0 Long Term Support (LTS) version is preferred. After you choose a target framework, select **Create**. Visual Studio creates a new console app solution.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project name and select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

1. Select **Browse** and then search for **Microsoft.TSS**. For more information about this package, see [Microsoft.TSS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TSS). Choose the **Microsoft.TSS** package from the list, then select **Install**.

1. Edit the **Program.cs** file and replace the contents with the [tpm-read-nv sample code - Program.cs](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge-eflow/blob/main/samples/tpm-read-nv/Program.cs).

1. Select **Build > Build solution** to build the project. Verify that the build is successful.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, then select **Publish**.

1. In the **Publish** wizard, choose **Folder > Folder**. Select **Browse** and then choose an output location for the executable file to be generated. Select **Finish**. After the publish profile is created, select **Close**.

1. On the **Publish** tab, select **Show all settings**. Change the following configuration, then select **Save**:

    - Target Runtime:  **linux-x64**.
    - Deployment mode: **Self-contained**.

1. Select **Publish**, then wait for the executable to be created.

If publishing succeeds, you should see the new files created in your output folder.

## Copy and run the executable

Once the executable file and dependency files are created, copy the folder to the CBL-Mariner virtual machine. The following steps show how to copy all the necessary files and how to run the executable inside the CBL-Mariner virtual machine.

1. Open an elevated PowerShell session.

1. Change directory to the parent folder that contains the published files.

    For example, if your published files are under the folder **TPM** in the directory **C:\Users\<User>**, you can use the following command to change to the parent folder:

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Users\<User>"
    ```

1. Modify the **TPMRead.runtimeconfig.json** file to avoid an [ICU globalization issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2186#issuecomment-472629489) inside the Linux VM:

    1. Open **TPMRead.runtimeconfig.json**.
    2. Add the following line inside the `configProperties` section:

       ```json
       "System.Globalization.Invariant": true
       ```

1. Create a **tar** file with all the files created in previous steps. For more information about PowerShell **tar** support, see [Tar and Curl Come to Windows](/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20171219-tar-and-curl-come-to-windows).

    For example, if you have all your files under the folder **TPM**, you can use the following command to create the **TPM.tar** file:

    ```powershell
    tar -cvzf TPM.tar ".\TPM"
    ```

1. Once the **TPM.tar** file is successfully created, use the `Copy-AksEdgeNodeFile` cmdlet to copy the **tar** file to the CBL-Mariner VM. For example, if you have the **tar** file name **TPM.tar** in the directory **C:\Users\<User>**, you can use the following command to copy to the CBL-Mariner VM:

    ```powershell
    Copy-AksEdgeNodeFile -fromFile "C:\Users\<User>\TPM.tar" -toFile "/home/aksedge-user/" -pushFile
    ```

1. Run the following command to extract all the content from the **tar** file:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "tar -xvzf /home/aksedge-user/TPM.tar"
   ```

1. After extraction, add executable permission to the main executable file. For example, if your project name was **TPMRead**, your main executable is named **TPMRead**. Run the following command to make it executable:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "chmod +x /home/aksedge-user/TPM/TPMRead"
    ```

1. The last step is to run the executable file. For example, if your project name is **TPMRead**, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "/home/aksedge-user/TPM/TPMRead"
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following:
