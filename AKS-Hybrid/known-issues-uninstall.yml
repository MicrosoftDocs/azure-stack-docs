      - question: | 
          Uninstall-AksHCI does not clean up cluster resources ('ownergroup ca-<GUID>')

        answer: | 
          Due to insufficient permissions in Active Directory, [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/uninstall-akshci.md) could not remove cluster resource objects in Active Directory, which can lead to failures in subsequent deployments. 
          
          To fix this issue, ensure that the user performing the installation has **Full Control** permissions to create/modify/remove Active Directory objects in the Active Directory container in which the server and service objects are created.
      - question: | 
          Uninstall-AksHciAdAuth fails with the error '[Error from server (NotFound): secrets "keytab-akshci-scale-reliability" not found]'

        answer: | 
          If [Uninstall-AksHciAdAuth](./reference/ps/./uninstall-akshciadauth.md) displays this error, you should ignore it for now as this issue will be fixed.
          
          `This issue will be fixed.`
      - question: | 
          Running the Remove-ClusterNode command evicts the node from the failover cluster, but the node still exists

        answer: | 
          When running the [Remove-ClusterNode](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/remove-clusternode?view=windowsserver2019-ps&preserve-view=true) command, the node is evicted from the failover cluster, but if [Remove-AksHciNode](./reference/ps/remove-akshcinode.md) is not run afterwards, the node will still exist in CloudAgent.
          
          Since the node was removed from the cluster, but not from CloudAgent, if you use the VHD to create a new node, a _File not found_ error appears. This issue occurs because the VHD is in shared storage, and the evicted node does not have access to it.
          
          To resolve this issue, remove a physical node from the cluster and then follow the steps below:
          
          1. Run `Remove-AksHciNode` to de-register the node from CloudAgent.
          2. Perform routine maintenance, such as re-imaging the machine.
          3. Add the node back to the cluster.
          4. Run `Add-AksHciNode` to register the node with CloudAgent.
      - question: | 
          Running Remove-AksHciCluster results in the error: 'Error: unable to delete group clustergroup-spdb:...'

        answer: | 
          When running [Remove-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/remove-akshcicluster.md), the following error occurs because there may be a deadlock:
          
          `Error: unable to delete group clustergroup-spdb: failed to delete group clustergroup-spdb: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded`
          
          To resolve this issue, restart CloudAgent. 
      - question: | 
          When using kubectl to delete a node, the associated VM might not be deleted

        answer: | 
          You'll see this issue if you follow these steps:
          
          1. Create a Kubernetes cluster.
          2. Scale the cluster to more than two nodes.
          3. Delete a node by running the following command: 
            ```powershell
            kubectl delete node <node-name>
            ```
          
          4. Return a list of the nodes by running the following command:
            ```powershell
            kubectl get nodes
            ```
            The removed node isn't listed in the output.
          5. Open a PowerShell with administrative privileges and run the following command:
            ```powershell
            get-vm
            ```
          The removed node is still listed.
          
          This failure causes the system not to recognize that the node is missing, and therefore, a new node will not spin up. 
          
      - question: | 
          Running Remove-AksHciCluster results in the error: 'A workload cluster with the name 'my-workload-cluster' was not found'

        answer: | 
          You may encounter this error when running [Remove-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/remove-akshcicluster.md).
          
          Check to make sure you have used the correct information for removing the cluster.
      - question: | 
          Error occurs when running Uninstall-AksHci and AKS on Azure Stack HCI is not installed

        answer: | 
          If you run [Uninstall-AksHci](./reference/ps/./uninstall-akshci.md) when AKS on Azure Stack HCI is not installed, you'll receive the error message: _Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Path' because it is null_. 
          
          You can safely ignore the error message as there is no functional impact.
