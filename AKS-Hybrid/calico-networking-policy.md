# Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

Use this step-by-step guide to verify and try out basic pod-to-pod connectivity and to use Calico network policies in a cluster in an Azure Kubernetes Server (AKS) deployment. In this guide, you'll learn how to create client and server pods on Linux and Windows nodes, verify connectivity between the pods, and then apply a basic network policy to isolate pod traffic in AKS hybrid.

## Prerequisites

 To deploy AKS hybrid, follow the steps to [set up an AKS host](./kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell.md).

To use this guide, you'll need:

- An AKS workload cluster.
- At least one Windows worker node deployed in the cluster.
- At least one Linux worker node deployed in the cluster.
- The Calico network plug-in must be enabled when creating the workload cluster. If this plug-in wasn't enabled, see [`New-AksHciCluster`](./reference/ps/new-akshcicluster.md) for instructions.
 
## Create pods on Linux nodes

First, create a client pod, _busybox_, and server pod, _nginx_, on the Linux nodes.

### Create a YAML file called policy-demo-linux.yaml

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: calico-demo

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: busybox
  name: busybox
  namespace: calico-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - sleep 360000
    image: busybox:1.28
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: busybox
  nodeSelector:
    beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: calico-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.8
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  nodeSelector:
    beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux

```

### Apply the policy-demo-linux.yaml file to the Kubernetes cluster

Open a PowerShell window, and load the credentials for your target cluster using the [`Get-AksHciCredential`](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) command. 

Next, use `kubectl` to apply the `policy-demo-linux.yaml` configuration, as shown below:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f policy-demo-linux.yaml
```

## Create pods on Window nodes

Create a client pod _pwsh_ and server pod _porter_ on the Windows nodes. 

> [!Note]
> The pods' manifest uses images based on `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809`. If you are using a more recent Windows Server version, update the manifests to use a Server Core image that matches your Windows Server version.

### Create the policy-demo-windows.yaml

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pwsh
  namespace: calico-demo
  labels:
    app: pwsh
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pwsh
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809
    args:
    - powershell.exe
    - -Command
    - "Start-Sleep 360000"
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/os: windows
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: porter
  namespace: calico-demo
  labels:
    app: porter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: porter
    image: calico/porter:1809
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    env:
    - name: SERVE_PORT_80
      value: This is a Calico for Windows demo.
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/os: windows
```

### Apply the policy-demo-windows.yaml file to the Kubernetes cluster

Open a PowerShell window, and load the credentials for your target cluster using the [`Get-AksHciCredential`](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) command. 

Next, use `kubectl` to apply the `policy-demo-windows.yaml` configuration:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f policy-demo-windows.yaml
```

### Verify the four pods are created and running

> [!Note]
> Depending on your network download speed, it may take time to launch the Windows pods.

Open a PowerShell window, and load the credentials for your target cluster using the [`Get-AksHciCredential`](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) command. 

Next, use `kubectl` to list the pods in the `calico-demo` namespace:

```powershell
kubectl get pods --namespace calico-demo
```

You should see output similar to what's shown below:

```output
NAME      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
busybox   1/1     Running             0          4m14s
nginx     1/1     Running             0          4m14s
porter    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          74s
pwsh      0/1     ContainerCreating   0          2m9s
```

Repeat the command every few minutes until the output shows all four pods in the Running state.

```output
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
busybox   1/1     Running   0          7m24s
nginx     1/1     Running   0          7m24s
porter    1/1     Running   0          4m24s
pwsh      1/1     Running   0          5m19s
```

### Check connectivity between pods on Linux and Windows nodes

Now that the client and server pods are running on both Linux and Windows nodes, verify that client pods on Linux nodes can reach server pods on Windows nodes.

1. Open a PowerShell window, and load the credentials for your target cluster using the [`Get-AksHciCredential`](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) command.

2. Use `kubectl` to determine the porter pod IP address:

    ```powershell
    kubectl get pod porter --namespace calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}'
    ```

3. Sign in to the _busybox_ pod and try to reach the _porter_ pod on port 80. Replace the '<porter_ip>' tag with the IP address returned from the previous command.

    ```powershell
    kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo busybox -- nc -vz <porter_ip> 80
    ```

   You can also combine both of the above steps:

    ```powershell
    kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo busybox -- nc -vz $(kubectl get pod porter --namespace calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}') 80
    ```

   If the connection from the _busybox_ pod to the _porter_ pod succeeds, you'll get output similar to what's shown below:

    ```output
    192.168.40.166 (192.168.40.166:80) open
    ```

   > [!Note]
   > The IP addresses returned will vary depending on your environment setup.

4. Verify that the _pwsh_ pod can reach the _nginx_ pod:

    ```powershell
    kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo pwsh -- powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://$(kubectl get po nginx -n calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}') -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
    ```

    If the connection succeeds, you'll see output similar to:

    ```output
    StatusCode        : 200
    StatusDescription : OK
    Content           : <!DOCTYPE html>
                        <html>
                        <head>
                        <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
                        <style>
                            body {
                                width: 35em;
                                margin: 0 auto;
                                font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
                            }
                        </style>
                        <...
    ```

5. Verify that the _pwsh_ pod can reach the _porter_ pod:

    ```powershell
    kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo pwsh -- powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://$(kubectl get po porter -n calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}') -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
    ```

    If that succeeds, you'll see something similar to what's shown below:

    ```output
    StatusCode        : 200
    StatusDescription : OK
    Content           : This is a Calico for Windows demo.
    RawContent        : HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                        Content-Length: 49
                        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
                        Date: Fri, 21 Aug 2020 22:45:46 GMT
    
                        This is a Calico for Windows demo.
    Forms             :
    Headers           : {[Content-Length, 49], [Content-Type, text/plain;
                        charset=utf-8], [Date, Fri, 21 Aug 2020 22:45:46 GMT]}
    Images            : {}
    InputFields       : {}
    Links             : {}
    ParsedHtml        :
    RawContentLength  : 49

    ```

You have now verified that communication is possible between all pods in the application.

## Apply the policy to the Windows client pod

In a real-world deployment, you would want to make sure only pods that are supposed to communicate with each other are allowed to do so.

To achieve this, you apply a basic network policy that allows only the _busybox_ pod to reach the _porter_ pod.

### Create the network-policy.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-busybox
  namespace: calico-demo
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: porter
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: busybox
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

### Apply the network-policy.yaml file

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. Load the credentials for your target cluster using the [`Get-AksHciCredential`](./reference/ps/get-akshcicredential.md) command. 
3. Use `kubectl` to apply the network-policy.yaml file.

   ```powershell
   kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
   ```

### Verify the policy is in effect

With the policy in place, the _busybox_ pod should still be able to reach the _porter_ pod. As noted earlier in this topic, you can combine the steps in the command line:

```powershell
kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo busybox -- nc -vz $(kubectl get po porter -n calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}') 80
```

However, the _pwsh_ pod won't be able to reach the _porter_ pod:

```powershell
kubectl exec --namespace calico-demo pwsh -- powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://$(kubectl get po porter -n calico-demo -o 'jsonpath={.status.podIP}') -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
```

The request times out with a message like this one:

```output
Invoke-WebRequest : The operation has timed out.
At line:1 char:1
+ Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.40.166 -UseBasicParsing -Timeout ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (System.Net.HttpWebRequest:Htt
pWebRequest) [Invoke-WebRequest], WebException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand
command terminated with exit code 1
```

In this demo, we've configured pods on Linux and Windows nodes, verified basic pod connectivity, and tried a basic network policy to isolate pod-to-pod traffic.

As the final step, you can clean up all of the demo resources:

```powershell
kubectl delete namespace calico-demo
```
 
## Next steps
