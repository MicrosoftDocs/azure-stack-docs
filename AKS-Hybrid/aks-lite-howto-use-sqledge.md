# # Azure SQL Edge

Azure SQL Edge is an optimized relational database engine geared for IoT deployments, providing capabilities to create a high-performance data storage and processing layer for IoT applications and solutions.

In this demo, you will learn to deploy an Azure SQL Edge container on your AKS-IoT cluster.

## Step 1: Create namespace and password

First, create a namespace by running:

```powershell
kubectl create namespace sqledge
```

Then, we will create a secret password:

```powershell
kubectl create secret generic mssql --from-literal=SA_Password="MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd" -n sqledge
```

Replace `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` with your own password.

## Step 2: Deploy SQL Edge

Now in your powershell, navigate to the path of the samples folder by entering `cd <path to samples folder>`. Now run:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f sqledge\ -n sqledge
```

This will:

- Create a local storage (learn more about creating local storage on your AKS-IoT cluster [here](/docs/additionalconfigs.md))
- Create a persistent volume and persistent volume claim (learn more about [PVs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolume) and [PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolumeclaim))
- Deploy SQL Edge

## Step 3: Run SQL

We also need to allow this to run as the root user. In order to do this, we need to SSH into the SQL Edge pod. In order to get the pod name, run:

```powershell
kubectl get pods -n sqledge
```

Then copy the full pod name which looks something like: `sqledge-deployment-<pod id>`. Then run:

```powershell
kubectl exec -it <sqledge-deployment-pod> -n sqledge --bash
```

Once you're in the bash shell of the pod, run the following command, replacing `MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd` with the password you created earlier:

```bash
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P "MyC0m9l&xP@ssw0rd"
```

Now you are ready to use SQL Edge!

You can use the following resources to learn how to use Azure SQL Edge:

- [Create and query data with Azure SQL Edge](/azure/azure-sql-edge/disconnected-deployment#create-and-query-data)
- [Create a data streaming job in Azure SQL Edge](/azure/azure-sql-edge/create-stream-analytics-job)

## Step 4: Clean up deployments

Once you're finished with SQL Edge, go into your powershell, navigate to the samples folder, and clean up your workspace by running:

```powershell
kubectl delete -f sqledge -n sqledge
kubectl delete namespace sqledge
```
