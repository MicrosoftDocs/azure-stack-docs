# Deploy an application

This article describes how to deploy a containerized application on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

To get started, set up your [single machine Kubernetes](aks-edge-howto-single-node-deployment.md) or [full Kubernetes](aks-edge-howto-multi-node-deployment.md) cluster.

## Deploy a sample Linux application

### Step 1: update the manifest file

This article uses a sample application that is a simple voting app consisting of a front and back end, which is based on Microsoft's **azure-vote-front** image. The container image for this application is hosted on Azure Container Registry (ACR). See [linux-sample.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/blob/main/samples/others/linux-sample.yaml) in the GitHub repo package for the deployment manifest. Note that in the YAML we specified a `nodeSelector` tag as **Linux**.

### Step 2: deploy the application

To deploy your application, use the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command. This command parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects. Specify the YAML manifest file, as shown in the following example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/main/samples/others/linux-sample.yaml
```

### Step 3: verify the pods

Wait a few minutes for the pods to be in the **running** state:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### Step 4: verify the services

To monitor progress, use the [kubectl get services][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` parameter:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/linux-services-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Linux services running." lightbox="media/aks-edge/linux-services-running.png":::

Initially, the `EXTERNAL-IP` for the `azure-vote-front` service is shown as `pending`. When the `EXTERNAL-IP` address changes from `pending` to an actual public IP address, you can use the IP address assigned to the service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On single machine clusters, if you deployed your Kubernetes cluster without specifying a `-ServiceIPRangeSize`, you will not have allocated IPs for your workload services and you won't have an external IP address. In this case, find the IP address of your Linux VM (`Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr`):

```powershell
Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr -NodeType Linux
```

You can now append the external port to the VM's IP address (for example, **192.168.1.12:30432**).

### Step 5: test your application

To see the application in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service:

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/linux-app-up.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Linux apps that are running." lightbox="media/aks-edge/linux-app-up.png":::

If the application doesn't load, it might be due to an authorization problem with your image registry. To view the status of your containers, use the `kubectl get pods` command. If the container images can't be retrieved, see [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration?bc=/azure/container-registry/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=/azure/container-registry/toc.json).

### Step 6: remove application

To clean up, delete all resources using the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/main/samples/others/linux-sample.yaml
```

## Deploy a sample Windows application to your cluster

This example runs a sample ASP.NET application based on [Microsoft's sample image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples/). See [win-sample.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/blob/main/samples/others/win-sample.yaml). Note that the YAML specifies the `nodeSelector` tag as **Windows**.

### Step 1: deploy the application by specifying the name of your YAML manifest

Make sure you are in the directory of the YAML in a PowerShell window, then run the following command:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/main/samples/others/win-sample.yaml
```

### Step 2: verify that the sample pod is running

It might take a while for the pod to reach the running status, depending on your internet connection. The ASP.NET image is large:

```powershell
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/win-pods-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Windows pods running." lightbox="media/aks-edge/win-pods-running.png":::

### Step 3: verify that the sample service is running

```powershell
kubectl get services
```

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/win-svc-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Windows services running." lightbox="media/aks-edge/win-svc-running.png":::

Since this sample is deployed as a service of type **NodePort**, you can retrieve the IP address of the Kubernetes node on which the application is running, then append the port of the **NodePort**. Get the IP of the Kubernetes node using the following `Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr`command:

```powershell
Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr -NodeType Windows
```

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/win-cluster-info.png" alt-text="Screesnhot showing Windows cluster information." lightbox="media/aks-edge/win-cluster-info.png":::

### Step 4: verify your running Windows sample

Open a web browser and locate the **NodePort** to access your service:

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/win-app-up.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Windows app running." lightbox="media/aks-edge/win-app-up.png":::

### Step 5: clean up

To clean up, delete all resources using the following command:

```powershell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKS-IoT-preview/main/samples/others/win-sample.yaml
```

## Deploying your own applications

The previous steps showed how you can deploy our sample applications. To deploy your own application, do the following:

- Package your application into a container image, and then upload the image to Azure Container Registry or in a container registry of your choice. Review these steps to [create a container image of your application](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-application.md).
- AKS Edge Essentials enables mixed-OS clusters. Ensure your pods get scheduled on nodes with the corresponding OS. Add `nodeSelector` to your deployment files. This will tell Kubernetes to run your pods on nodes of a particular operating system (OS). If your cluster is single-OS, then you can skip this step; but for best practice, label each deployment file with node selectors:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector:
        "kubernetes.io/os": linux
    ```

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector:
        "kubernetes.io/os": windows
    ```
