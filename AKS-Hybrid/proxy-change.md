# Update proxy server settings, certificates in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

In this article, learn how to update proxy settings and certificates for your deployment in AKS hybrid. Each AKS deployment has a single global proxy configuration. You can add exclusions using the `noProxy` parameter to exclude private subnets (for example, contoso.com) from using the proxy server, and you can update proxy certificates for the deployment. You can't change HTTP or HTTPS settings.

For information about the initial proxy server setup, see [Use proxy server settings in AKS hybrid](set-proxy-settings.md).

## Proxy settings you can update

Before you begin, review current limitations to proxy settings updates in AKS hybrid:

- AKS hybrid supports one global proxy configuration per AKS hybrid deployment. When you update the proxy settings, they're updated for the entire AKS hybrid deployment.

- You can only update `noProxy` settings, which are used to exclude a private subnet from using the proxy server, and proxy certificates. HTTP and HTTPs proxy settings can't be updated.

- You can't configure different proxy settings for a specific node pool or workload cluster. By the same token, you can't update proxy settings for a specific node pool or workload cluster.

- **Updates to proxy settings are only applied after you update your entire AKS deployment.** You must update the AKS host management cluster and all AKS hybrid workload clusters. To check whether an update is available, use the AKS PowerShell module cmdlet [Get-AksHciClusterUpdates](reference/ps/get-akshciclusterupdates.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you update proxy settings for an AKS deployment, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Your AKS deployment is running the [October build](https://github.com/Azure/aks-hybrid/releases/tag/AKS-hybrid-2210) or later.

* The most recent version of the AksHci PowerShell module is installed. For more information, see [Install the AksHci PowerShell module](kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell.md#install-the-akshci-powershell-module).

* At least one update is available for your AKS deployment. Updates to proxy settings and certificates are applied automatically after updates are applied to an AKS deployment. To check for available updates, run the [`Get-AksHciClusterUpdates`](/azure-stack/aks-hci/reference/ps/get-akshciclusterupdates) command in the AksHci PowerShell module.

## Step 1: Update noProxy settings

You may occasionally need to update `noProxy` settings to exclude a private subnet from using the proxy server for your AKS deployment. To update the `noProxy` settings, you'll store a new exclusion list in a PowerShell variable.

1. Before you update your `noProxy` settings, review the required `noProxy` settings in the [proxy exclusion table](set-proxy-settings.md#exclusion-list-for-excluding-private-subnets-from-being-sent-to-the-proxy).

   Certain exclusions are required for your AKS hybrid deployment to function. Not excluding these URLs may cause failures in your AKS hybrid deployment.

1. Store your updated `noProxy` URL list in a PowerShell variable:

   ```powershell  
   $noProxy = "localhost,127.0.0.1,.svc,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16,.contoso.com"
   ```

## Step 2: Create proxy certificate bundle

To update certificates for your proxy server, create a new certificate bundle and then store the path to the file in a PowerShell variable. You'll bundle the certificates in a single .crt file in PEM format. This format is applicable for updating certificates on Linux container hosts.

<!--Removing this temporarily. - To learn more about how to update certificates, read [update certificate bundle for your AKS hybrid deployment](update-certificate-bundle.md#certificate-format).

- Specify the certificates in a single .crt file in PEM format. This format is applicable for updating certificates on Linux container hosts.

- It's important to add the certificates to a single .crt file in this order: leaf certificate > intermediate certificate > root certificate. For example, `<.leaf.crt>`, `<intermediate.crt>`, `<root.crt>`.

- The contents of the certificate file aren't validated. Check carefully to ensure the file contains the right certificates and is in the correct format.-->

1. Create a single .crt file with the bundled certificates for Linux hosts. Use the `concatenate` (`cat`) command with the following format:

   ```bash
   cat [leaf].crt  [intermediate].crt  [Root].crt > [bundle].crt
   ```

   You must concatenate the certificates in the order of: *leaf certificate* > *intermediate certificate* > *root certificate*. For detailed certificate requirements and an example, see [Update certificate bundle for your AKS hybrid deployment](update-certificate-bundle.md#certificate-format).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The contents of the certificate file aren't validated. Check carefully to ensure the file contains the right certificates and is in the correct format.

1. Store the path to your updated certificate bundle in a PowerShell variable:

   ```powershell
   $certFile ="/../[certificate-bundle].crt" # path to the bundled .crt file
   ```

## Step 3: Update proxy settings

The next step is to use the `Set-AksHciProxySetting` command to update your `noProxy` settings and certificates.

1. Before you update the proxy changes, confirm that your PowerShell variables have the right changes:

   ```PowerShell
   echo $noProxy
   echo $certFile
   ```

1. To update your proxy settings and proxy certificates both, run the following command:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-AksHciProxySetting -noProxy $noProxy -certFile $certFile
   ```

### Step 4: Apply updated global proxy settings to your AKS hybrid deployment

The updates to your global proxy settings and certificate are applied automatically after you update the AKS deployment.

To apply the proxy updates:

1. Check whether an update is available for your AKS host management cluster by running the following command:

   ```powershell  
   Get-AksHciUpdates
   ```

1. If an update is available, update your AKS host management cluster by running the following command. This command applies the proxy changes on your AKS host management cluster.

   ```powershell  
   Update-AksHci
   ```

2. Update all of the workload clusters in your AKS hybrid deployment. Proxy changes won't be applied unless you update your workload clusters.

   1. To check whether workload cluster updates are available, run the following command on each of your AKS workload clusters:

      ```powershell  
      Get-AksHciClusterUpdates -name mycluster
      ```

   1. If an update is available (either a Kubernetes version or an updated OS image), update each of your workload clusters by running the `Update-AksHciCluster` command.

      * To update the Kubernetes version and OS version on a workload cluster, run the following command:

        ```powershell  
        Update-AksHciCluster -name mycluster
        ```

      * To update the OS without updating the Kubernetes version, include the  `-operatingSystem` parameter:

        ```powershell  
        Update-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -operatingSystem
        ```

        If an OS image-only update isn't available for your workload cluster, you won't be able to apply the proxy changes unless you update the Kubernetes version.
