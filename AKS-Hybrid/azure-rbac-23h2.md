# Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) for Kubernetes authorization

Applies to: AKS on Azure Stack HCI 23H2

Infrastructure administrators can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who can access the *kubeconfig* file and the permissions they have. Kubernetes operators can interact with Kubernetes clusters using the **kubectl** tool based on the given permissions. Azure CLI provides an easy way to get the access credentials and kubeconfig configuration file to connect to your AKS clusters using **kubectl**.

When you use integrated authentication between Microsoft Entra ID and AKS, you can use Microsoft Entra users, groups, or service principals as subjects in [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](concepts-security-access-identity.md). This feature frees you from having to separately manage user identities and credentials for Kubernetes. However, you still must set up and manage Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC separately.

This article describes how to use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes cluster authorization with Microsoft Entra ID and Azure role assignments.

For a conceptual overview, see [Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization](concepts-security-access-identity.md) for AKS enabled by Azure Arc.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- AKS on Azure Stack HCI 23H2 currently supports enabling Azure RBAC only during Kubernetes cluster creation. You can't enable Azure RBAC after the Kubernetes cluster is created.
- Install the latest version of the **aksarc** and **connectedk8s** Azure CLI extensions. Note that you need to run the **aksarc** extension version 1.1.1 or later to enable Azure RBAC. Run `az --version` to find the current version. If you need to install or upgrade Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

  ```azurecli
  az extension add --name aksarc
  az extension add --name connectedk8s
  ```

  If you already installed the `aksarc` extension, update the extension to the latest version:

  ```azurecli
  az extension update --name aksarc
  az extension update --name connectedk8s
  ```
  
- To interact with Kubernetes clusters, you must install [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and [**kubelogin**](https://azure.github.io/kubelogin/install.html).
- You need the following permissions to enable Azure RBAC while creating a Kubernetes cluster:
  - To create a Kubernetes cluster, you need the **Azure Kubernetes Service Arc Contributor** role.
  - To use the `--enable-azure-rbac` parameter, you need the **Role Based Access Control Administrator** role for access to the **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permission. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/general).
  - New role assignments can take up to five minutes to propagate and be updated by the authorization server.
- Once Azure RBAC is enabled, you can access your Kubernetes cluster with the given permissions using either direct mode or proxy mode.
  - To access the Kubernetes cluster directly using the `az aksarc get-credentials` command, you need the **Microsoft.HybridContainerService/provisionedClusterInstances/listUserKubeconfig/action**, which is included in the **Azure Kubernetes Service Arc Cluster User** role permission.
  - To access the Kubernetes cluster from anywhere with a proxy mode using the `az connectedk8s proxy` command, or from the Azure portal, you need the **Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action** action, which is included in the **Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes Cluster User** role permission. Meanwhile, you must verify that the agents and the machine performing the onboarding process meet the network requirements specified in [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes network requirements](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/network-requirements?tabs=azure-cloud#details).
- To use **kubectl**, you can access it using either Azure RBAC or the AAD Admin Group.
  - To use kubectl with Azure RBAC, you need the **Azure Arc Kubernetes Viewer** role scoped to the connected cluster resource.
  - To use kubectl with the AAD Admin Group, you don't need any specific role, but you must ensure you are in one of the groups in the **add-admin-group** list of the connected cluster resource.

## Step 1: Create an Azure RBAC-enabled Kubernetes cluster

You can create an Azure RBAC-enabled Kubernetes cluster for authorization and a Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.

```azurecli
az aksarc create -n $aks_cluster_name -g $resource_group_name --custom-location $customlocation_ID --vnet-ids $logicnet_Id --generate-ssh-keys --control-plane-ip $controlplaneIP --enable-azure-rbac
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

## Step 2: Create role assignments for users to access the cluster

[!INCLUDE [built-in-roles](includes/built-in-roles.md)]

You can use the [`az role assignment create`](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command to create role assignments.

First, get the `$ARM-ID` for the target cluster to which you want to assign a role.

```azurecli
$ARM_ID = (az connectedk8s show -g "$resource_group_name" -n $aks_cluster_name --query id -o tsv)
```

Then, use the `az role assignment create` command to assign roles to your Kubernetes cluster. You must provide the `$ARM_ID` from the first step and the `assignee-object-id` for this step. The `assignee-object-id` can be a Microsoft Entra ID or a service principal client ID.

The following example assigns the **Azure Arc Kubernetes Viewer** role to the Kubernetes cluster:

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "Azure Arc Kubernetes Viewer" --assignee <assignee-object-id> --scope $ARM_ID
```

In this example, the scope is the Azure Resource Manager ID of the cluster. It can also be the resource group containing the Kubernetes cluster.

### Create custom role definitions

You can choose to create your own role definition for use in role assignments.

The following example shows a role definition that allows a user to only read deployments. For more information, see [the full list of data actions that you can use to construct a role definition](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftkubernetes). For more information about creating a custom role, see [Steps to create a custom role](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role)

To create your own custom role definitions, copy the following JSON object into a file called **custom-role.json**. Replace the `<subscription-id>` placeholder with the actual subscription ID. The custom role uses one of the data actions and lets you view all deployments in the scope (cluster or namespace) where the role assignment is created.

```json
{
    "Name": "AKS Arc Deployment Reader",
    "Description": "Lets you view all deployments in cluster/namespace.",
    "Actions": [],
    "NotActions": [],
    "DataActions": [
        "Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/apps/deployments/read"
    ],
    "NotDataActions": [],
    "assignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>"
    ]
}
```

For information about custom roles and how to author them, see [Azure custom roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles).

Create the role definition using the [`az role definition create`](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-create) command, setting the `--role-definition` parameter to the **deploy-view.json** file you created in the previous step:

```azurecli
az role definition create --role-definition @deploy-view.json 
```

Assign the role definition to a user or other identity using the [`az role assignment create`](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command:

```azurecli
az role assignment create --role "AKS Arc Deployment Reader" --assignee <assignee-object-id> --scope $ARM_ID
```

## Step 3: Access Kubernetes cluster

You can now access your Kubernetes cluster with the given permissions, using either direct mode or proxy mode.

### Access your cluster with kubectl (direct mode)

To access the Kubernetes cluster with the given permissions, the Kubernetes operator needs the Microsoft Entra **kubeconfig**, which you can get using the [`az aksarc get-credentials`](/cli/azure/aksarc#az-aksarc-get-credentials) command. This command provides access to the admin-based kubeconfig, as well as a user-based kubeconfig. The admin-based kubeconfig file contains secrets and should be securely stored and rotated periodically. On the other hand, the user-based Microsoft Entra ID kubeconfig doesn't contain secrets and can be distributed to users who connect from their client machines.

To run this Azure CLI command, you need the **Microsoft.HybridContainerService/provisionedClusterInstances/listUserKubeconfig/action**, which is included in the **Azure Kubernetes Service Arc Cluster User** role permission:

```azurecli
az aksarc get-credentials -g "$resource_group_name" -n $aks_cluster_name --file <file-name>
```

Now you can use kubectl manage your cluster. For example, you can list the nodes in your cluster using `kubectl get nodes`. The first time you run it, you must sign in, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli
kubectl get nodes
```

### Access your cluster from a client device (proxy mode)

To access the Kubernetes cluster from anywhere with a proxy mode using `az connectedk8s proxy` command, you need the **Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action**, which is included in **Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes Cluster User** role permission.

Run the following steps on another client device:

1. Sign in using Microsoft Entra authentication
1. Get the cluster connect **kubeconfig** needed to communicate with the cluster from anywhere (even from outside the firewall surrounding the cluster):

     ```azurecli
     az connectedk8s proxy -n $CLUSTER_NAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > This command opens the proxy and blocks the current shell.

1. In a different shell session, use `kubectl` to send requests to the cluster:

   ```powershell
   kubectl get pods -A
   ```

You should now see a response from the cluster containing the list of all pods under the `default` namespace.

For more information, see [Access your cluster from a client device](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/cluster-connect?tabs=azure-cli%2Cagent-version#access-your-cluster-from-a-client-device).

## Clean up resources

### Delete role assignment

```azurecli
# List role assignments
az role assignment list --scope $ARM_ID --query [].id -o tsv

# Delete role assignments
az role assignment delete --ids <LIST OF ASSIGNMENT IDS>
```

### Delete role definition

```azurecli
az role definition delete -n "AKS Arc Deployment Reader"
```
