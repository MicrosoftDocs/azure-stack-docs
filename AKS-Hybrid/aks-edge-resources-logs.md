# AKS Edge Essentials logs

If you experience issues running AKS Edge Essentials IoT Edge in your environment, use this article as a guide for gathering and using logs. 

## Get logs

Your first step when troubleshooting AKS Edge Essentials should be to gather logs. The most convenient way is to use the `Get-AksEdgeLogs` command. By default, this cmdlet collects different logs around VM management, networking, Kubernetes services, and more. It compresses them into a single file for easy sharing.

To get the AKS Edge Essentials logs, use the following steps

1. Open an elevated PowerShell session.
1. Run the cmdlet to get the logs:

    ```powershell
    Get-AksEdgeLogs
    ```
1. All logs are stored in a .zip file under the following path: **C:\ProgramData\AksEdge\logs\aksedge-logs-ddmmyy-hhmm.zip**. 
1. Go to the **C:\ProgramData\AksEdge\logs** folder and unzip the **aksedge-logs-ddmmyy-hhmm.zip** logs file.

## Understanding logs

The compressed log file consists of different configuration files, deployment and services logs, and information about host OS and deployed cluster. Depending on the cluster state, Kubernetes distribution and host OS, some files may not be available. 

### Windows host OS logs

| File name | Group |  Description |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ | 
| **aksedgeevents.xml** | Windows Event Log | Windows events logged during deployment or VM lifecycle. To manually check these events, use Event Viewer application and check the events under *Applications and Services Logs* -> *AKS Edge Essentials- K3s/K8s*.
| **aksedgehost-systeminfo** | Information | Windows host OS information including: PowerShell version, Windows OS version, CPU, Memory and Storage. |
| **Microsoft-Windows-Host-Network-Service-Admin.xml** | Windows Event Log | HNS service Windows Event Log - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Host-Network-Service-Operational.xml** | Windows Event Log | HNS operational service Windows Event Log - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Compute-Admin.xml**| Windows Event Log | Events from the Host Compute Service [HCS](/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20170127-introducing-the-host-compute-service-hcs) are collected here - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Compute-Operational.xml** | Windows Event Log | Events from the Host Compute Service [HCS](/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20170127-introducing-the-host-compute-service-hcs) are collected here - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Admin.xml** | Windows Event Log | Events from the virtual machine management service (VMMS) can be found here - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Networking.xml** | Windows Event Log | Events from the virtual machine management service (VMMS) networking stack can be found here - Internal use only. | 
| **Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Operational.xml** | Windows Event Log | Events from the virtual machine management service (VMMS) operation can be found here - Internal use only. | 

### Wssdagent logs

The WSSDAgent is the AKS Edge Essentials service used for virtual machines creation and lifecycle management. This service runs on the Windows host OS and uses Hyper-V API implementations (HCS or VMMS) to manage the VMs. 

| File name | Group |  Description |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ | 
| **agent-log-0** | VM Information | Virtual machines lifecycle logs - Internal use only.| 
| **wssdagent** | VM Information | Virtual machines lifecycle logs - Internal use only. |
| **Other files** | Deployment configurations | Internal use only. | 

### Linux-containers logs

Linux containers running inside the Linux nodes use `/var/log/continers/<container-name>.log` files to store container logs. All these `.log` files are copied and compressed under the *linux-containers* folder. 

### AKS Edge nodes logs

These logs should be independent of the cluster type and the Kubernetes distribution being used (K3s or K8s).

| File name | Group |  Description |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ | 
| **aksedgeconfig.txt** | Deployment configurations | Stores deployments configurations being used to create the cluster. Both internal and user-provided configurations are stored in this file. | 
| **aksedgelogs-summary** | Information | Details around which logs were collected and included in the logs compressed file. |
| **AksEdgenetworkConfig_LinuxVm** | VM Information | Output of networking configurations: IP addresses of network interfaces (`sudo ip a`), routes being used (`sudo route`) and *iptables* firewall rules (`sudo iptables -L`).
| ***\<Windows-hostname\>*-ledge_cloudinit** & ***\<Windows-hostname\>*-ledge_cloudinit-output** | VM Information | Output of cloudinit configurations used for the Linux VM creation. For more information, check [cloudinit docs](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). | 
| ***\<Windows-hostname\>*-ledge_systemd** | VM information | Logs of Linux *systemd* (`sudo journalctl`). |
| ***\<Windows-hostname\>*-ledge_vmconfig** | Deployment configurations | Linux virtual machine configurations - Internal use only. |
| ***\<Windows-hostname\>*-ledge-aksedge-agent** | VM information | Linux virtual machine deployment logs - Internal use only. |
