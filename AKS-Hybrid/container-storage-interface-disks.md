This article describes how to use Container Storage Interface (CSI) built-in storage classes to dynamically create disk persistent volumes and create custom storage classes in AKS hybrid.

## Overview of CSI in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [csi-in-aks-hybrid-overview](includes/csi-in-aks-hybrid-overview.md)]

## Dynamically create disk persistent volumes using built-in storage class

A *storage class* is used to define how a unit of storage is dynamically created with a persistent volume. For more information on how to use storage classes, see [Kubernetes storage classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). 

In AKS hybrid, the `default` storage class is created by default and uses CSV to create VHDX-backed volumes. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying VHDX is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. The storage class also configures the persistent volumes to be expandable; you just need to edit the persistent volume claim with the new size.

To leverage this storage class, create a [PVC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) and a respective pod that references and uses it. A PVC is used to automatically provision storage based on a storage class. A PVC can use one of the pre-created storage classes or a user-defined storage class to create a VHDX of the desired size. When you create a pod definition, the PVC is specified to request the desired storage.

## Create custom storage class for disks

The default storage class is suitable for most common scenarios. However, in some cases, you may want to create your own storage class that stores PVs at a particular location mapped to a specific performance tier.

If you have Linux workloads (pods), you must create a custom storage class with the parameter `fsType: ext4`. This requirement applies to Kubernetes versions 1.19 and 1.20 or later. The example below shows a custom storage class definition with `fsType` parameter defined:

```YAML
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: aks-hci-disk-custom
parameters:
  blocksize: "33554432"
  container: SqlStorageContainer
  dynamic: "true"
  group: clustergroup-summertime
  hostname: TESTPATCHING-91.sys-sqlsvr.local
  logicalsectorsize: "4096"
  physicalsectorsize: "4096"
  port: "55000"
  fsType: ext4
provisioner: disk.csi.akshci.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion: true  
```

The default storage class stores PVs at the `-imageDir` location specified during the AKS host deployment. If you create a custom storage class, you can specify the location where you want to store PVs. If the underlying infrastructure is Azure Stack HCI, this new location could be a volume that's backed by high-performing SSDs/NVMe or a cost-optimized volume backed by HDDs.

Creating a custom storage class is a two-step process:

1. Create a new storage container using the following [New-AksHciStorageContainer](./reference/ps/new-akshcistoragecontainer.md) PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
   New-AksHciStorageContainer -Name <e.g. customStorageContainer> -Path <shared storage path>
   ```
   
   Check whether the new storage container is created by running the following [Get-AksHciStorageContainer](./reference/ps/get-akshcistoragecontainer.md) PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
    Get-AksHciStorageContainer -Name "customStorageContainer"
   ```

2. Create a new custom storage class using the new storage container.
   
   1. Create a file named `sc-aks-hci-disk-custom.yaml`, and then copy the manifest from the YAML file below. The storage class is the same as the default storage class except with the new `container`. For `group` and `hostname`, query the default storage class by running `kubectl get storageclass default -o yaml`, and then use the values that are specified.

      ```yaml
          kind: StorageClass
          apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
          metadata:
           name: aks-hci-disk-custom
          provisioner: disk.csi.akshci.com
          parameters:
           blocksize: "33554432"
           container: customStorageContainer
           dynamic: "true"
           group: <e.g clustergroup-akshci> # same as the default storageclass
           hostname: <e.g. ca-a858c18c.ntprod.contoso.com> # same as the default storageclass
           logicalsectorsize: "4096"
           physicalsectorsize: "4096"
           port: "55000"
           fsType: ext4 # refer to the note above to determine when to include this parameter
          allowVolumeExpansion: true
          reclaimPolicy: Delete
          volumeBindingMode: Immediate
      ```

   2. Create the storage class with the [kubectl apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply/) command and specify your `sc-aks-hci-disk-custom.yaml` file: 
  
      ```console
       $ kubectl apply -f sc-aks-hci-disk-custom.yaml
       storageclass.storage.k8s.io/aks-hci-disk-custom created
      ```
