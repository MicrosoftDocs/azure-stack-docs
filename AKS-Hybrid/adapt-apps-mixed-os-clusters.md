AKS hybrid enables you to run Kubernetes clusters with both Linux and Windows nodes, but you'll need to make small edits to your apps for use in these mixed-OS clusters. In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to ensure your application gets scheduled on the right host OS using either node selectors or taints and tolerations.

This how-to guide assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for AKS hybrid](kubernetes-concepts.md).

## Node selectors

A *node selector* is a simple field in the pod specification YAML that constrains pods to only be scheduled onto healthy nodes matching the operating system. In your pod specification YAML, specify a `nodeSelector` for Windows or Linux, as shown in the examples below. 

```yaml
kubernetes.io/os = Windows
```
or,

```yaml
kubernetes.io/os = Linux
```

For more information, see [node selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/). 

## Taints and tolerations

**Taints** and **tolerations** work together to ensure that pods aren't scheduled on nodes unintentionally. A node can be "tainted" not to accept pods that don't explicitly tolerate its taint through a "toleration" in the pod specification YAML.

Windows OS nodes in AKS hybrid can be tainted when created with the [New-AksHciNodePool](./reference/ps/new-akshcinodepool.md) command or the [New-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/new-akshcicluster.md) command. You can also use these commands to taint Linux OS nodes. The following example taints Windows nodes.

### Apply taint to new cluster

If you are also creating a new cluster, run the following command to create a Windows node pool with a taint. If you have an existing cluster that you want to add a node pool with a taint to, go to the next example, which uses the `New-AksHciNodePool` command.

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -nodePoolName taintnp -nodeCount 1 -osType windows -taints sku=Windows:NoSchedule
```

### Add tainted node pool to existing cluster

To add a tainted node pool to an existing cluster, run the following command:

```powershell
New-AksHciNodePool -clusterName <cluster-name> -nodePoolNAme taintnp -count 1 -osType windows -taints sku=Windows:NoSchedule
```

 To check that the node pool was successfully deployed with the taint, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-AksHciNodePool -clusterName <cluster-name> -name taintnp
```

**Example Output**
```Output
Status       : {Phase, Details}
ClusterName  : mycluster
NodePoolName : taintnp
Version      : v1.20.7-kvapkg.1
OsType       : Windows
NodeCount    : 0
VmSize       : Standard_K8S3_v1
Phase        : Deployed
Taints       : {sku=Windows:NoSchedule}
```

### Specify toleration for pod

You specify a toleration for a pod in the pod specification YAML. The following toleration "matches" the taint created by the `kubectl` taint line shown above. The result is that a pod with the toleration will be able to schedule onto the tainted nodes.

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: node.kubernetes.io/os
  operator: Equal
  value: Windows
  effect: NoSchedule
```

### Using taints when you can't access the pod spec

The steps in this section work well if you're in control of the pod spec that you're deploying. However, in some cases, users have a pre-existing large number of deployments for Linux containers, as well as an ecosystem of common configurations, such as community [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-search-finding-charts). You won't have access to the pod spec unless you want to download and edit the chart.

If you deploy these Helm charts to a mixed cluster environment with both Linux and Windows worker nodes, your application pods will fail with the error "ImagePullBackOff" - for example:

```powershell
C:\>kubectl get pods
NAMESPACE              NAME                                                    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
default                nginx-deployment-558fc78868-795dp                       0/1     ImagePullBackOff    0          6m24s
default                nginx-deployment-6b474476c4-gpb77                       0/1     ImagePullBackOff    0          11m
```

In this instance, you should look at using [taints](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-taints) to help with this.
Windows Server nodes can be tainted with the following key-value pair: node.kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule

## Next steps

In this how-to guide, you learned how to add node selectors or taints and tolerations to your Kubernetes clusters using `kubectl`. Next, you can:

- [Deploy a Windows Server application on a Kubernetes cluster](./deploy-windows-application.md).
