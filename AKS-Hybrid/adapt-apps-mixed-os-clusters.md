AKS enabled by Arc enables you to run Kubernetes clusters with both Linux and Windows nodes, but you must make small edits to your apps for use in these mixed-OS clusters. This how-to guide describes how to ensure your application gets scheduled on the right host OS using either node selectors or taints and tolerations.

This article assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for AKS enabled by Arc](kubernetes-concepts.md).

## Node selectors

A *node selector* is a simple field in the pod specification YAML that constrains pods to only be scheduled onto healthy nodes matching the operating system. In your pod specification YAML, specify a `nodeSelector` value of Windows or Linux, as shown in the following examples:

```yaml
kubernetes.io/os = Windows
```

or,

```yaml
kubernetes.io/os = Linux
```

For more information about node selectors, see [node selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/).

## Taints and tolerations

**Taints** and **tolerations** work together to ensure that pods aren't unintentionally scheduled on nodes. A node can be "tainted" to reject pods that don't explicitly tolerate its taint through a "toleration" in the pod specification YAML.

Windows OS nodes in AKS Arc can be tainted when created with the [New-AksHciNodePool](./reference/ps/new-akshcinodepool.md) or the [New-AksHciCluster](./reference/ps/new-akshcicluster.md) commands. You can also use these commands to taint Linux OS nodes. The following example taints Windows nodes.

### Apply taint to new cluster

If you also create a new cluster, run the following command to create a Windows node pool with a taint. If you have an existing cluster to which you want to add a node pool with a taint, see the next example, which uses the `New-AksHciNodePool` command.

```powershell
New-AksHciCluster -name mycluster -nodePoolName taintnp -nodeCount 1 -osType Windows -osSku Windows2022 -taints sku=Windows:NoSchedule
```

### Add tainted node pool to existing cluster

To add a tainted node pool to an existing cluster, run the following command:

```powershell
New-AksHciNodePool -clusterName <cluster-name> -nodePoolNAme taintnp -count 1 -osType Windows -osSku Windows2022 -taints sku=Windows:NoSchedule
```

To check that the node pool was successfully deployed with the taint, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-AksHciNodePool -clusterName <cluster-name> -name taintnp
```

Example output:

```output
Status       : {Phase, Details}
ClusterName  : mycluster
NodePoolName : taintnp
Version      : v1.20.7-kvapkg.1
OsType       : Windows
NodeCount    : 0
VmSize       : Standard_K8S3_v1
Phase        : Deployed
Taints       : {sku=Windows:NoSchedule}
```

### Specify toleration for pod

You can specify a toleration for a pod in the pod specification YAML. The following toleration "matches" the taint created by the `kubectl` taint line shown in the previous example. The result is that a pod with the toleration can schedule onto the tainted nodes.

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: node.kubernetes.io/os
  operator: Equal
  value: Windows
  effect: NoSchedule
```

The steps in this section work well if you're in control of the pod spec that you're deploying. However, in some cases, users have a pre-existing large number of deployments for Linux containers, as well as an ecosystem of common configurations, such as community [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-search-finding-charts). You won't have access to the pod spec unless you want to download and edit the chart.

If you deploy these Helm charts to a mixed cluster environment with both Linux and Windows worker nodes, your application pods fail with the error "ImagePullBackOff". For example:

```powershell
kubectl get pods
```

```output
NAMESPACE              NAME                                                    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
default                nginx-deployment-558fc78868-795dp                       0/1     ImagePullBackOff    0          6m24s
default                nginx-deployment-6b474476c4-gpb77                       0/1     ImagePullBackOff    0          11m
```

In this instance, you can use [taints](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-taints) to help with this. Windows Server nodes can be tainted with the key-value pair `node.kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule`.

For more information about taints and tolerations, see [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).
