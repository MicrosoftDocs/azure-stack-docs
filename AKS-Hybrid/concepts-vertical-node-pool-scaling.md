You can change the size of the virtual machines in a given node pool, to increase the resources available to the node pool in AKS enabled by Azure Arc.

To keep up with app demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. In some cases, scaling a cluster horizontally by adding nodes isn't sufficient to meet the demands from your app for more CPU cores or memory.

Without vertical node scaling, you must redeploy to a new node pool and move the app. This situation might not be ideal in resource limited edge environments. To enable this flexibility, AKS Arc introduces the capability to change the virtual machine (VM) size (SKU) of the VMs in a given node pool.

## How vertical node scaling in AKS Arc works

In AKS Arc, target cluster node pools are managed internally as a **machineDeployment**. One property of a **machineDeployment** is the VM size (SKU) that was selected when the `New-AksHciNodePool` command was executed.

To change the node pool to a different VM size (SKU), you can use the `Set-AksHciNodePool` command for changing the VM size for worker nodes and the `Set-AksHciCluster` command to change the VM size for control plane nodes.

When you submit the command with the new VM size (SKU), a new **machineDeployment** for the node pool or cluster is created, replacing the existing machine set. This event triggers an update flow in the underlying deployment system. Similar to an OS or Kubernetes version upgrade, the new **machineDeployment** uses a rolling update to replace one virtual machine in the node pool or control plane after the other. Each upgrade checks that the old node is correctly cordoned and drained before it's removed.

> [!NOTE]
> The system assumes that enough hardware resources are available to scale up the new machine set in place of the old machine set.

## Example process

The following example illustrates vertical node scaling.

### Change the VM size for a Linux worker node pool from 4 cores and 6 GB of memory to 4 cores and 8 GB of memory

First, check the current VM size of the node pool on cluster `mycluster`. From the output, you can see the VM size is `Standard_K8S3_v1`:

``` powershell
get-akshcinodepool -clustername mycluster
```

```output
Status       : {Error, Phase, Details}
ClusterName  : mycluster
NodePoolName : mycluster-linux
Version      : v1.22.4
OsType       : Linux
NodeCount    : 2
VmSize       : Standard_K8S3_v1
Phase        : scaling
```

`Standard_K8S3_v1` in the list of available VM sizes shows that it has 4 cores and 6 GB of memory:

``` powershell
Get-AksHciVmSize
```

```output
VmSize           CPU MemoryGB
------           --- --------
Default          4   4
Standard_A2_v2   2   4
Standard_A4_v2   4   8
Standard_D2s_v3  2   8
Standard_D4s_v3  4   16
Standard_D8s_v3  8   32
Standard_D16s_v3 16  64
Standard_D32s_v3 32  128
Standard_DS2_v2  2   7
Standard_DS3_v2  2   14
Standard_DS4_v2  8   28
Standard_DS5_v2  16  56
Standard_DS13_v2 8   56
Standard_K8S_v1  4   2
Standard_K8S2_v1 2   2
Standard_K8S3_v1 4   6
```

The new size you want to set for 4 cores and 8 GB of memory is `Standard_A4_v2`. To update the node pool `mycluster-linux`, use the `Set-AksHciNodePool` cmdlet, which has been updated to accept a `-VMsize` parameter:

``` powershell
Set-AksHciNodePool -ClusterName mycluster -name mycluster-linux -vmsize Standard_A4_v2
```

After a few minutes, the process is complete. You can check the result by running `Get-AksHciNodePool` again and verify that the `VmSize` is now `Standard_A4_v2`:

``` powershell
get-akshcinodepool -clustername mycluster
```

```output
Status       : {Error, Phase, Details}
ClusterName  : mycluster
NodePoolName : mycluster-linux
Version      : v1.22.4
OsType       : Linux
NodeCount    : 2
VmSize       : Standard_A4_v2
Phase        : scaling
```
