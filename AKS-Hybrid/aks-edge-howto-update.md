# Update your AKS Edge Essentials clusters

As newer versions of AKS Edge Essentials are available, you can update your AKS Edge Essentials cluster for the latest features and security improvements. This article describes how to update and upgrade your AKS Edge Essentials devices when fixes and a new version are available.

The AKS Edge Essentials cluster is comprised of two main components that need to be updated. First is the Mariner Linux VM. This virtual machine is installed as a part of the AKS Edge Essentials MSI, and has no package manager, so you can't manually update or change any of the VM components. Instead, the virtual machine is managed with Microsoft Update to keep the components up to date automatically. Second, the Kubernetes platform can be upgraded to stay in sync with the open-source version and the AKS service.  

The AKS Edge Essentials virtual machine is reliably updated via Microsoft Update. The virtual machine uses A/B update partition scheme, to make each update safe and enable a roll-back to a previous version if anything goes wrong during the update process.

AKS Edge Essentials upgrades are sequential and you must upgrade to every version. To get to the latest version, you'll have to either do a fresh installation using the latest available version, or apply all the previous servicing updates, up to the desired version.

> [!CAUTION]
> Updating full deployments across multi-machines is currently an experimental feature.

## Step 1: Configure the host machine to receive updates using Microsoft Update

To receive AKS Edge Essentials updates, configure the Windows host to receive updates for other Microsoft products. By default, Microsoft Updates is turned on during AKS Edge Essentials installation. If custom configuration is needed after installation, you can turn this option on or off with the following steps:

1. Open **Settings** on the Windows host.
1. Select **Updates & Security**.
1. Select **Advanced options**.
1. Toggle the **Receive updates for other Microsoft products when you update Windows** button to **On**.

Microsoft Update in the Windows Update subsystem can now scan for an update for AKS Edge Essentials based on the Windows Update policy set on the machine. If you want to force the scan immediately, you can select **Check for updates**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft updates needs to be enabled on all machines in the cluster.

Once the update is downloaded from either the cloud endpoint or a local WSUS server, it can now be staged and installed on all the nodes on a machine.

## Step 2: Update the primary control node

First, update the primary control node, by running the following command on the primary control node:

```powershell
Start-AksEdgeUpdate
```

When this command returns, your version will be running in the new updated/patched version.

## Step 3: Update the secondary control nodes

If you have more control nodes in your deployment, you can now update them using the following command:

```powershell
Start-AksEdgeUpdate -secondaryControlPlaneUpdate
```

## Step 4: Update worker nodes

Update the worker nodes in your cluster by running the following command on each of the worker nodes:

```powershell
Start-AksEdgeUpdate -secondaryControlPlaneUpdate
```

## Step 5: Complete the update

Open a PowerShell window with administrative privileges and run the following command on all the nodes in the cluster:

```powershell
Start-AksEdgeWorkerNodeUpdate 
```

## Update using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

On-premises updates using WSUS is supported for AKS Edge Essentials updates. For more information about WSUS, see [Device Management Overview - WSUS](/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/device-management/device-management-overview#windows-server-update-services-wsus).

## Upgrade to newer versions

AKS Edge Essentials currently supports Kubernetes version 1.24.3 on both K3s and K8s. As we continue to add support to newer versions, you can use over-the-air updates to the newer versions. To upgrade your clusters to newer versions, set the `Set-AksEdgeUpgrade` command to `true`:

```powershell
Set-AksEdgeUpgrade â€“ AcceptUpgrade $true
```

You can then select the **Check for Updates** button to download and stage an update if applicable. Then, run the `Start-AksEdgeUpdate` to complete the update:

```powershell
Start-AksEdgeUpdate
```

This command then triggers the version upgrade.
