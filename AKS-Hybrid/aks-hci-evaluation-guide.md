We have updated the evaluation guide based on customer feedback to reflect changes in the product and provide a better end to end experience that is closer to real life use cases. Jumpstart HCI Box is a turnkey solution that provides a complete sandbox for exploring AKS hybrid, Azure Stack HCI capabilities and hybrid cloud integration in a virtualized environment. HCIBox is designed to be completely self-contained within a single Azure subscription and resource group, which will make it easy for a user to get hands-on with AKS hybrid, Azure Stack HCI and Azure Arc technology without the need for physical hardware.

To access the Jumpstart HCI Box experience click [here](https://aka.ms/jumpstarthcibox) and follow the deployment instructions.

>[!NOTE]
> We recommend deleting all resources created with the previous version of the evaluation experience to avoid conflicts and extra cost due to the size of the virtual machines created.
