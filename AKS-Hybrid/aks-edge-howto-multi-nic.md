# AKS Edge Essentials multiple NIC configurations

By default, the AKS Edge Essentials Linux node has a single network interface card (NIC) assigned. However, you can configure the Linux node with multiple network interfaces during the deployment of your node. This functionality can be helpful in numerous scenarios where you might have a networking division or separation into different networks or zones. In order to connect an AKS Edge Essentials Linux node to the different networks, you must attach different network interface cards to the Linux node.

This article describes how to configure the AKS Edge Essentials Linux node to support multiple NICs and connect to multiple networks. The following steps summarize this process:

1. Create an AKS Edge Essentials deployment with a secondary NIC.
1. Verify multiple NIC network configuration settings.
1. Configure [Multus CNI plugin](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/demystifying-multus).
1. Configure Multus secondary network with sample pod.
1. Verify pod attached networks.

For more information about networking concepts and Multus configurations, see [AKS Edge Essentials networking](aks-edge-concept-networking.md) and [Multus - Quickstart guide](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md).

> [!NOTE]
> AKS Edge Essentials support for multiple NICs is limited to Linux nodes. If you need support for Windows nodes, you can file an issue/feature request in the [AKS Edge Essentials GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/issues).

## Create an AKS Edge Essentials deployment with a secondary NIC

To deploy a Linux node with multiple NICs, you must add your secondary interface cards in your deployment JSON file. Modify your deployment JSON file, and as part of the `LinuxNode.SecondaryNetworks` section, ensure that you specify a secondary network to be added to the Linux node. You can specify an array of `VMSwitchName` with optional static IP information (`Ip4Address`,`Ip4GatewayAddress` and `Ip4PrefixLength`):

1. Follow the steps in [Set up your machine](aks-edge-howto-setup-machine.md).

1. Create a Hyper-V virtual switch. For more information, see [Create and configure a virtual switch with Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/create-a-virtual-switch-for-hyper-v-virtual-machines?tabs=hyper-v-manager).

1. Modify the deployment JSON file. Add the following parameters to the `LinuxNode.SecondaryNetworks` section:

    | Parameter | Accepted values | Comments |
    | --------- | --------------- | -------- |
    | `VMSwitchName` | Name of the virtual switch. | Name of the virtual switch assigned to the Linux node. |  
    | `Ip4Address`| IPv4 address in the range of the DCHP server scope. | Static Ipv4 address of the Linux node. |
    | `Ip4GatewayAddress`| IPv4 address of the subnet gateway. | Gateway Ipv4 address, only valid when static Ipv4 address is specified. |
    | `Ip4PrefixLength` | IPv4 prefix length of the subnet. | Ipv4 subnet prefix length, only valid when static Ipv4 address is specified. |

    ```json
    {
    ...,
    "LinuxNode": {
        ...,
        "SecondaryNetworks": [
          {
            "VMSwitchName": <virtual-switch-name>,
            "Ip4Address": <linux-node-secondary-ip-address>,
            "Ip4GatewayAddress": <gateway-ip-address>,
            "Ip4PrefixLength": <ip-prefix-length>
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

1. Deploy your AKS Edge Essentials node following the steps in [Create a single machine deployment](aks-edge-howto-single-node-deployment.md), or [Create a full deployment](aks-edge-howto-multi-node-deployment.md).

## Verify multiple NIC network configuration settings

After successfully installing and deploying the AKS Edge Essentials node, follow these steps to make sure both primary, and secondary interfaces were created and added to the Linux node:

1. Check the primary interface:

    ```powershell
    sudo ip addr eth0
    ```

1. Check the secondary network interface. If you added more than one extra interface, it appears as **ethX** with **X** being the number of extra network interfaces:

    ```powershell
    sudo ip addr eth1
    ```

## Configure Multus CNI plugin

After successfully installing and deploying the AKS Edge Essentials node, follow these steps to enable Multus:

1. Verify that the default network is ready by listing the Kubernetes nodes:

    ```powershell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. Clone the [Multus Cni repo](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni):

    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni.git
    ```

1. Change to the **multus-cni** project directory.

1. Navigate to the **deployments** folder to view the daemon set scripts used to configure Multus.

1. If you're using the **K3s** version, make the following edits to the **multus-daemonset.yml** script to make it compatible for use with K3s:

    1. Get the AKS Edge Essentials storage hash token. The hash can be located by going to **/var/lib/rancher/k3s/data/**.

        ```powershell
        Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "ls -AU /var/lib/rancher/k3s/data/ | head -1"
        ```

    1. Replace the following volume configuration lines:

        ```yaml
        volumes:
        - name: cni
            hostPath:
            path: /etc/cni/net.d
        - name: cnibin
            hostPath:
            path: /opt/cni/bin
        ```

        Use the storage hash token from the previous step and replace the configuration with the following lines:

        ```yaml
        volumes:
        - name: cni
            hostPath:
            path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d
        - name: cnibin
            hostPath:
            path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/data/<replace-with-your-hash>/bin
        ```

    1. Replace the following container configuration lines:

        ```yaml
        containers:
        - name: kube-multus
            image: ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni:snapshot
            command: ["/thin_entrypoint"]
            args:
            - "--multus-conf-file=auto"
            - "--multus-autoconfig-dir=/host/etc/cni/net.d"
            - "--cni-conf-dir=/host/etc/cni/net.d"
        ```

        Replace them with the appropriate **K3s** container configuration:

        ```yaml
        containers:
        - name: kube-multus
            image: nfvpe/multus:v3.4.1
            command: ["/entrypoint.sh"]
            args:
            - "--multus-conf-file=auto"
            - "--cni-version=0.3.1"
            # Add the following arg
            - "--multus-kubeconfig-file-host=/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d/multus.d/multus.kubeconfig"
        ```

1. Apply the updated Multus daemon set file using the following command:

    ```powershell
    kubectl apply -f multus-daemonset.yml
    ```

If everything is correctly installed, Kubernetes starts the Multus daemon set, which runs a pod on each node, and results in a Multus binary to be placed on each node in **/var/lib/rancher/k3s/data/[replace-with-your-hash]/bin**.

The daemon set reads the first alphabetical configuration file in **/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d**, and creates a new configuration file for Multus on each node as **/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d/00-multus.conf**. This file is autogenerated and is based on the default network configuration. It also creates a **/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d/multus.d** directory on each node with authentication information for Multus to access the Kubernetes API.

### Validate Multus installation

The installation can check the following information:

1. All files listed previously were generated by looking at the specified directory paths:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "sudo ls -l /var/lib/rancher/k3s/data/<replace-with-your-hash>/bin | grep multus"
    ```

1. Ensure that the Multus pods ran without error by running this command:

    ```powershell
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -i Multus
    ```

1. Check the **00-multus.conf** file to ensure the correct CNI version is specified. Update the CNI version value to **0.3.1** if that isn't already the default value:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType "Linux" -command "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/cni/net.d/00-multus.conf"
    ```

## Configure Multus secondary network with sample pod

Once the Multus plugin is installed and running, create the Kubernetes network attachment definition.

1. Create a **secondarynet-conf.yaml** yaml file for the secondary network. A part of the [Multus quickstart installation](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md), creates a **CRD** (custom resource definition), which can be used to define the configuration for all extra interfaces. The following sample YAML file adds a secondary network:

    ```yaml
    # This net-attach-def defines secondarynet-conf
    apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
    kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
    metadata:
    name: secondarynet-conf
    spec:
    config: '{
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "plugins": [
            {
            "type": "bridge",
            "bridge": "mynet1",
            "ipam": {}
            }
        ]
        }'
    ---
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The official Multus documentation specifies a `macvlan` type secondary interface. However, the `macvlan` plugin isn't available by default. To use this plugin, install it before specifying the secondary net configuration. For more information about various network plugins and their sample configurations, see [Using the Multus CNI in OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/using-the-multus-cni-in-openshift).

1. Create the secondary interface using the **secondarynet-conf.yaml** created in the previous step:

    ```powershell
    kubectl apply -f secondarynet-conf.yaml
    ```

1. Create a **samplepod.yaml** file to deploy a sample pod that attaches to the previously created secondary interface. The following YAML code is a sample for creating a new pod that uses the secondary interface:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: samplepod
    annotations:
        k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: secondarynet-conf
    spec:
    containers:
    - name: samplepod
        command: ["/bin/ash", "-c", "trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait"]
        image: alpine
    ```

1. Create the sample pod using the `samplepod.yaml` created in the previous step:

    ```powershell
    kubectl apply -f samplepod.yaml
    ```

## Verify pod attached networks

The final step is to ensure that the pod is running and has the correct network interfaces attached.

1. Check that the pod is running:

    ```powershell
    kubectl get pods
    ```

1. Inspect the pod, and see what interfaces are attached:

    ```powershell
    kubectl exec -it samplepod -- ip a
    ```

    There are three interfaces:

    - **lo**: a loopback interface
    - **eth0**: the default network
    - **net1**: the new interface created using secondarynet-conf
