# Get kubelet logs from cluster nodes in AKS hybrid

As part of operating an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in AKS hybrid, you may need to review logs at some point to troubleshoot a problem. You can [view logs](./view-logs.md) for AKS, and you may also need to get _kubelet_ logs from an AKS node for troubleshooting purposes. This topic shows you how to use `journalctl` to view the _kubelet_ logs on a node.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see this [quickstart](kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell.md) for deploying AKS hybrid.

## Create an SSH connection

First, you need to create an SSH connection with the node on which you need to view _kubelet_ logs. To sign in using SSH, see [connect with SSH](./ssh-connection.md) for Windows and Linux worker nodes.

## Get kubelet logs

Once you have connected to the node, run the following command to pull the _kubelet_ logs:

```console
sudo journalctl -u kubelet -o cat
```
The following sample output shows the kubelet log data:

```output
I0512 19:15:19.651370    1824 server.go:411] Version: v1.19.7
