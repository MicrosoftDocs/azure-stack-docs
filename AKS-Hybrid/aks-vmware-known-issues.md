# Known issues in AKS enabled by Azure Arc on VMware

[!INCLUDE [aks-applies-to-vmware](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-applies-to-vmware.md)]

This article identifies important known issues and their workarounds in the AKS enabled by Azure Arc on VMware preview. You can also [review the troubleshooting guide](aks-vmware-troubleshooting-guide.md) or follow the [troubleshooting overview](aks-vmware-support-troubleshoot.md) to report bugs or provide product feedback.

We continuously update this page. As we identify critical problems that require workarounds, we add them here. Review this information carefully before deploying AKS Arc on VMware.

| Known issue               | Root cause/issue description                                                                                                                | Workaround/comments                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VM size **Standard_A4_v2**  | The VM size **Standard_A4_v2** is currently deployed with incorrect specifications: 2 vCPU and 8 GB memory. It should be 4 vCPU and 8 GB memory.  | We're aware of the problem and are working on a resolution. If you have issues with the default configuration, try deploying the target cluster control plane with **Standard_D4s_v3**. |
 | Control Plane IP is in use | This error indicates that the control plane IP is in use, even though it may not be in use by any party. |  1. Before you create an AKS cluster, ping the control plane IP to check if it's already in use.<br /> 2. If the system returns an error stating "control plane IP is in use" and it's actually not currently in use, try creating an AKS cluster using a different control plane IP.  |
  | If you pass the `--node-vm-size` option for `az aksarc create`, or `--node-vm-size` for `az aksarc nodepool add`, you might get a 404 error when Azure CLI attempts to make a GET request for a list of compatible VM sizes. | This is a k8s-bridge limitation. |  Call `az aksarc vmsize list` to make a PUT call, which allows the VM size list to be retrieved for future GET calls.  |
   | If you are installing the Kuberentes extension from the Arc-enabled VMware vSphere onboarding step script, `az aksarc create` may fail with Error: **Internal Reconcile Error occured: Error updating AksCluster enable autoscaling: AKSCluster.infrastructure.aks.microsoft.com " " not found**  | Currently, AKS on VMware only supports the "default" namespace. |  Please ensure you update the namespace of your custom location to "default" in the onboarding script: **$customLocationNamespace = ("default".ToLower() -replace '[^a-z0-9-]', '')**  |
