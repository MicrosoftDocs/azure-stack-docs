# AKS Edge Essentials networking

This article describes how to configure the networking between the Windows host OS and the Linux and Windows nodes' virtual machines. For more information about AKS Edge Essentials architecture, see the [AKS Edge Essentials overview](./aks-edge-overview.md).

>[!TIP]
>The following guide describes different networking concepts and configurations available in AKS Edge Essentials. If you are using a single machine cluster, the installer and deployment mechanism handle all the necessary networking configuration. No extra steps or configuration are needed to deploy your cluster.

## Networking

This guide assumes that you have control over your network and router (that is, in a home setting). If you are in a corporate environment, we recommend you ask your network administrator for a range of free IP addresses (from the same subnet) that are reachable on the internet.

To establish a communication channel between the Windows host OS and the Linux and Windows virtual machines, we use a Hyper-V networking stack. For more information about Hyper-V networking, see [Hyper-V networking basics](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/plan/plan-hyper-v-networking-in-windows-server#hyper-v-networking-basics).

The following key networking concepts for AKS Edge Essentials align with Kubernetes concepts:

- **Virtual switch**: Hyper-V component that allows virtual machines created on Hyper-V hosts to communicate with other computers. For more information, see [Create and configure a virtual switch with Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/create-a-virtual-switch-for-hyper-v-virtual-machines?tabs=hyper-v-manager). AKS Edge Essentials supports two types of virtual switches:
  - **Internal**: Connects to a network that can be used only by the virtual machines running on the Windows host OS that has the virtual switch, and between the host OS and the virtual machines.
  - **External**: Connects to a wired, physical network by binding to a physical network adapter. It gives virtual machines access to a physical network to communicate with devices on an external network. In addition, it enables virtual machines on the same Hyper-V server to communicate with each other.
- **Control plane endpoint IP address**: The Kubernetes control plane is reachable from this IP address. You must provide a single IP that is free throughout the lifetime of the cluster for the Kubernetes control plane.
- **Service IP addresses range**: The Service IP range is a pool of reserved IP addresses used for allocating IP addresses to the Kubernetes services (your Kubernetes services/workloads), for your applications to be reachable.
- **Virtual machine IP address**: In AKS Edge Essentials, Kubernetes nodes are deployed as specialized virtual machines, which need IP addresses. You must assign free IPs to these VMs.

## Networking by deployment type

If AKS Edge Essentials is deployed using a single machine cluster or a scalable cluster, we support different types of switches, IP address assignation, and configurations, as shown in the following table.

|                     | Single Machine Cluster | Scalable Cluster |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Type of virtual switch** | Internal | External |
| **Virtual switch creation** | Automatic | Manually by user or automatically based on physical net adapter name. |
| **IP address assignment** | Automatic – Addresses defined | Static IP addresses configured by user. |
| **Outbound connections** | Using virtual switch | Directly using the physical net adapter. |
| **Inbound connections** | Not reachable | Using the virtual machine IP address. |
| **DNS** | Configurable using the `DnsServers` parameter – if not provided, use Windows host DNS servers. | Configurable using `DnsServers` parameter – if not provided, use Windows host DNS servers. |
| **Proxy** | Configurable using the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` parameters. | Configurable using `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` parameters. |
| **Offline deployment** | Supported using the `InternetDisabled` parameter. | Supported using the `InternetDisabled` parameter. |
| **Service IP range** | If the `ServiceIPRangeSize` parameter is defined, starts at **192.168.0.4**. | Both the `ServiceIPRangeStart` and `ServiceIPRangeSize` parameters can be defined. |
| **Static MAC Address** | Supported using the `MacAddress` parameter. | Supported using the `MacAddress` parameter. |
| **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** | Supported using the `MTU` parameter. | Supported using the `MTU` parameter. |

## Single machine cluster

Single machine deployments use an internal virtual switch to manage the networking. This type of deployment must have a Linux node; a Windows node is optional. The following diagram shows a single machine deployment architecture using internal virtual switch:

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/networking-single-machine.jpg" alt-text="Diagram showing the network architecture using internal virtual switch." lightbox="media/aks-edge/networking-single-machine.jpg":::

During single machine deployment, AKS Edge Essentials creates an internal virtual switch named **aksedgesw-int**, as well as the appropriate virtual network adapters to connect the virtual machines and the Windows host OS. The setup also handles the IP address assignment and address translation for the NICs. For example, IP addresses of the virtual NICs could be defined as follows:

- **Windows host OS**: 192.168.0.**1**
- **Linux node virtual machine**: 192.168.0.**2**
- **Windows node virtual machine**: 192.168.0.**3**
- **Service IP addresses start**: 192.168.0.**4**

The **192.168.0.0/24** address family can change depending on the internal virtual switch; however, nodes and host OS will always have the same suffix: host OS (.1), Linux VM (.2), Windows VM (.3) and ServiceIP start (.4).

Finally, by using address translation, traffic is able to reach the external network using the physical network adapter. The previous diagram shows an external network using the **10.0.0.0/24** IP address family, but this depends on the networking environment in which the device is installed.

## Scalable cluster

In scalable cluster deployments, the nodes running inside the different devices must communicate between each other. Therefore, all nodes must be connected to the same network. To achieve this node-to-node communication across devices, AKS Edge Essentials scalable cluster deployments use external virtual switches. The following diagram shows a multi-machine deployment architecture using an external virtual switch:

:::image type="content" source="media/aks-edge/networking-multi-machine.jpg" alt-text="Diagram showing the network architecture using external virtual switch." lightbox="media/aks-edge/networking-multi-machine.jpg":::

To start this type of deployment, you must provide the following networking parameters during deployment:

- **AdapterName**: Name of the physical adapter connected to the external network. You can run the PowerShell `Get-NetAdapter -Physical` command to view the `Name` column for the adapter of your choice.
- **Ip4Address**: Specify the IP address your VM takes. Each node needs its own unique IP address.

Once deployment is finished, all nodes and the Windows host OS will be connected to the external network using the same external virtual switch. Because nodes are connected directly to the network, there's no need for address translation. The previous diagram shows a networking architecture using the **192.168.0.0/24** IP address family; however, this depends on the networking environment in which the devices are installed.

## Other networking concepts

### DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (for example, `www.microsoft.com`) to machine-readable IP addresses (for example, `192.0.2.44`). The AKS Edge Essentials Linux virtual machine uses [**systemd**](https://systemd.io/) (system and service manager), so the DNS or name resolution services are provided to local applications and services via the [systemd-resolved](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html) service. The Windows node uses the default Windows networking DNS service.

By default, during AKS Edge Essentials deployment, you can provide the DNS servers list using the `DnsServers` parameter. If no address is provided, the deployment mechanism looks for the Windows host OS DNS servers (check using `ipconfing /all`) and uses those server addresses.

It's possible to check the DNS servers being used for both Linux and Windows nodes. To do so, using an elevated PowerShell session run the following cmdlet:

- For Linux VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType Linux -command "resolvectl status"
    ```

    The command output shows a list of the DNS servers configured for each Linux VM interfaces. In particular, it's important to check the **eth0** interface status, which is the default interface for the AKS EE VM communication. Also, make sure to check the IP addresses of the **Current DNS Server** and **DNS Servers** fields of the list. If there's no IP address, or the IP address isn't a valid DNS server IP address, then the DNS service won't work.

- For Windows VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType Windows -command "ipconfig /all"
    ```

    The command output shows a list of the configured Windows VM network interfaces. In particular, it's important to check the **Ethernet adapter vEthernet (Ethernet)** interface status, which is the default interface for the AKS Edge Essentials VM communication. Also, make sure to check the IP addresses of the **DNS Servers**  field of the list. If there's no IP address, or the IP address isn't a valid DNS server IP address, then the DNS service won't work.

### Proxy

A proxy server is dedicated software that acts as a gateway between a client and the internet. It processes network requests as an intermediary: when you connect to a proxy server, your computer sends requests to the server rather than directly to the recipient. AKS Edge Essentials supports setting up proxy servers for both the Linux and Windows virtual machines.

By default, during AKS Edge Essentials deployment, you can provide the proxy configuration using the `Proxy.Http`, `Proxy.Https`, and `Proxy.No` parameters. If no parameters are provided, the deployment mechanism sets up the `no_proxy` flag with the necessary Kubernetes internal networking.

- For Linux VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType Linux -command 'env | grep proxy'
    ```

- For Windows VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-AksEdgeNodeCommand -NodeType Windows -command 'netsh winhttps show proxy'
    ```

### Static MAC address

Hyper-V allows you to create virtual machines with a **static** or **dynamic** MAC address. During AKS Edge Essentials virtual machine creation, you can provide the VM MAC address using the `MacAddress` parameter. If no value is provided, the MAC address is randomly generated and stored locally to keep the same address across virtual machines, or Windows host reboots. To query the AKS Edge Essentials virtual machine MAC address, you can use the following command:

- For Linux VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr -NodeType Linux
    ```

- For Windows VM nodes:

    ```powershell
    Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr -NodeType Windows
    ```
