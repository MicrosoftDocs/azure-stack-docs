# Secure communication with certificates in AKS hybrid

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-azure stack-hci-and-windows-server-skus](includes/aks-hci-applies-to-skus/aks-hybrid-applies-to-azure-stack-hci-windows-server-sku.md)]

Certificates are used to build secure communication between in-cluster components. AKS hybrid provides zero-touch, out-of-the-box provisioning, and management of certificates for built-in Kubernetes components. In this article, you'll learn how to provision and manage certificates in AKS hybrid.

## Certificates and CAs

AKS hybrid generates and uses the following Certificate Authorities (CAs) and certificates.

**Cluster CA**:
- The API server has a Cluster CA, which signs certificates for one-way communication from the API server to `kubelet`.
- Each `kubelet` also creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is signed by the Cluster CA, for communication from the `kubelet` to the API server.
- The etcd key value store has a certificate signed by the Cluster CA for communication from etcd to the API server. 

**etcd CA**:
- The etcd key value store has an etcd CA that signs certificates to authenticate and authorize data replication between etcd replicas in the cluster.

**Front Proxy CA**
- The Front Proxy CA secures communication between the API server and the extension API server.

### Certificate provisioning 

Certificate provisioning for a `kubelet` is done using [TLS bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/). For all other certificates, use YAML-based key and certificate creation. 

- The certificates are stored in **/etc/kubernetes/pki**.
- The keys are RSA 4096, EcdsaCurve: P384 

> [!NOTE]
> The root certificates are valid for 10 years. All other, non-root certificates are short-lived and valid for four days.

### Certificate renewal and management

Non-root certificates are automatically renewed. All control plane certificates for Kubernetes except the following certificates are managed:

- Kubelet server certificate 
- Kubeconfig client certificate 

As a security best practice, you should use [Active Directory single sign-in](./ad-sso.md) for user authentication.

## Certificate revocation

Certificate revocation should be rare, and it should be done at the time of certificate renewal. 

Once you have the serial number of the certificate you would like to revoke, use Kubernetes Custom Resource for defining and persisting revocation information. Each revocation object can consist of one or more revocation entries.  

To perform a revocation, use one of the following:

- Serial number 
- Group 
- DNS name 
- IP address  

A _notBefore_ time can be specified to revoke only certificates that are issued before a certain timestamp. If a _notBefore_ time is not specified, all existing and future certificates matching the revocation will be revoked. 

> [!NOTE]
> Revocation of `kubelet` server certificates is currently not available.

If you use a serial number when you perform a revocation, you can use the `Repair-AksHciClusterCerts` PowerShell command, described below, to get your cluster into a working state. If you use any of the other fields listed earlier, make sure to specify _notBefore_ time so you can recover your cluster using the `Repair-AksHciClusterCerts` command. 

```Console
apiVersion: certificates.microsoft.com/v1 
kind: RenewRevocation 
metadata: 
  name: my-renew-revocation 
  namespace: kube-system 
spec:

```

## Troubleshooting and maintenance

Refer to the following scripts and documentation for logging and monitoring:

- [Logging](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Logging)
- [Monitoring](https://github.com/microsoft/AKS-HCI-Apps/tree/main/Monitoring#certs-and-keys-monitoring)

### Renew certificates for worker nodes

For worker nodes, failed certificate renewals are logged by the *certificate-renewal-worker* pod. If the certificate renewal continues to fail on a worker node, and the certificates expire, the node is removed, and a new worker node is created in its place. 

Here's an example of viewing the logs for the pod with the prefix *certificate-renewal-worker*: 

```powershell
kubectl.exe --kubeconfig .\testcluster-kubeconfig -n=kube-system get pods 
```

```Output
NAME                                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE 
… 
certificate-renewal-worker-6f68k               1/1     Running            0          6d 
```

To get the logs from the certificate renewal pod:

```powershell
kubectl.exe --kubeconfig .\testcluster-kubeconfig -n=kube-system logs certificate-renewal-worker-6f68k
```

### Renew certificates for control plane nodes

For control plane nodes, failed certificate renewals are logged by the **certificate-renewal-controller** pod. If certificates expire on a control plane node, the node may eventually become unreachable by other nodes. If all control plane nodes enter this state, the cluster will become inoperable because of a TLS failure. To confirm whether the cluster has entered this state, try to access the cluster using `kubectl`, and then verify whether the connection fails with an error message related to expired x509 certificates. 

Here's an example of viewing the logs for the pod with the prefix *certificate-renewal-controller*:

```powershell
kubectl.exe --kubeconfig .\testcluster-kubeconfig -n=kube-system get pods 
```

```Output
NAME                                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE 
… 
certificate-renewal-controller-2cdmz               1/1     Running            0          6d 
```

To get the logs from the certificate renewal pod:

```powershell
kubectl.exe --kubeconfig .\testcluster-kubeconfig -n=kube-system logs certificate-renewal-controller-2cdmz
```

Control plane nodes can't be recreated like worker nodes, but you can use the **Repair-AksHciClusterCerts** module to help fix errors related to expired certificates. If the cluster begins to fail because of expired certificates, run the following command: 

```powershell
Repair-AksHciClusterCerts -Name mytargetcluster 
```

If the cluster becomes unreachable via `kubectl`, you can find the logs in the `/var/log/pods` folder.
