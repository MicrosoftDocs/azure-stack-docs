# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster by using Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)

* Deploy an Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster using an Azure Resource Manager template.

This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to create Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/../reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]


## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [kubernetes-cluster-prereq](./includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-prereq.md)]

## Review the template

Before deploying the Kubernetes template, let's review the content to understand its structure. 

:::code language="json" source="includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-arm-deploy.json":::

Once you have reviewed and saved the template file named ```kubernetes-deploy.json```, proceed to the next section to deploy the template.

## Deploy the template

1. Create a file named ```kubernetes-deploy-parameters.json``` and add the required parameters in JSON format. You can use the following example as a starting point. Replace the values with your own.

:::code language="json" source="includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-deploy-params.json":::

2. Deploy the template.

```azurecli
    az deployment group create \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --template-file kubernetes-deploy.json \
      --parameters @kubernetes-deploy-parameters.json
```

If there isn't enough capacity to deploy requested cluster nodes, an error message appears. However, this message doesn't provide any details about the available capacity. It states that the cluster creation can't proceed due to insufficient capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity calculation takes into account the entire platform cluster, rather than being limited to individual racks. Therefore, if an agent pool is created in a zone (where a rack equals a zone) with insufficient capacity, but another zone has enough capacity, the cluster creation continues but will eventually time out. This approach to capacity checking only makes sense if a specific zone isn't specified during the creation of the cluster or agent pool.

## Review deployed resources

## Connect to the cluster

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-cluster-connect](./includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-cluster-connect.md)]

## Add an agent pool
The cluster created in the previous step has a single node pool. Let's add a second agent pool using the ARM template. The following example creates an agent pool named ```myNexusK8sCluster-nodepool-2```:

1. Review the template.

Before adding the agent pool template, let's review the content to understand its structure. 

:::code language="json" source="includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-arm-add-node-pool.json":::

Once you have reviewed and saved the template file named ```kubernetes-add-agentpool.json```, proceed to the next section to deploy the template.

1. Create a file named ```kubernetes-nodepool-parameters.json``` and add the required parameters in JSON format. You can use the following example as a starting point. Replace the values with your own.

:::code language="json" source="includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-add-node-pool-params.json":::

2. Deploy the template.

```azurecli
    az deployment group create \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --template-file kubernetes-add-agentpool.json \
      --parameters @kubernetes-nodepool-parameters.json
```
